AB The Concern on the availability of clean and safe fresh water and the quality of recycled wastewater are important issues, which require a suitable technology to restore the water quality. Pharmaceuticals in waste water are not easily degraded by conventional water treatment technology. Advanced oxidation processes have been applied to eliminate traces of these compounds from aquatic environments. This study was focused on the degradation of ibuprofen (IBU) in aqueous solutions by catalytic and non-catalytic ozonation. Preliminary experiments were conducted to optimize the ozone concentration in water and to investigate other operation parameters. The operation parameters were: temperature, stirring rate, gas flow rate, pH, and use of Spinchem stirrer to reach higher concentrations of dissolved ozone. In general, the initial concentration of IBU was 10 mg/L, and about 93% of IBU was degraded after 4 h of ozonation under optimal conditions. Additional experiments were carried out to investigate the benefit of applying a solid catalyst. H-Beta and Fe-H-Beta type catalysts were immobilized in the Spinchem rotating bed device. The catalytic experiments illustrated a significant improvement in the degradation rate of IBU. The catalysts were characterized by nitrogen adsorption- desorption, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray powder diffraction and FTIR.

AB Experimental human exposure studies are an effective tool to study adverse health effects from acute inhalation of particulate matter and other constituents of air pollution. In this randomized and double-blinded crossover study, we investigated the systemic effect on bioactive lipid metabolite levels after controlled biodiesel exhaust exposure of healthy humans and compared it to filtered air at a separate exposure occasion. Eicosanoids and other oxylipins, as well as endocannabinoids and related lipids, were quantified in plasma from 14 healthy volunteers at baseline and at three subsequent time points (2, 6, and 24 h) after 1 h exposure sessions. Protocols based on liquid chromatography (LC) coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) methods were developed to detect temporal changes in circulating levels after biodiesel exhaust exposure. The exhaust was generated by a diesel engine fed with an undiluted rapeseed methyl ester fuel. Among the 51 analyzed lipid metabolites, PGF(2 alpha), 9,10-DiHOME, 9-HODE, 5-HETE, 11-HETE, 12-HETE, and DEA displayed significant responsiveness to the biodiesel exhaust exposure as opposed to filtered air. Of these, 9-HODE and 5-HETE at 24 h survived the 10% false discovery rate cutoff (p < 0.003). Hence, the majority of the responsive lipid metabolites were monohydroxy fatty acids. We conclude that it is possible to detect alterations in circulating bioactive lipid metabolites in response to biodiesel exhaust exposure using LC-MS/MS, with emphasis on metabolites with inflammation related properties and implications on cardiovascular health and disease. These observations aid future investigations on air pollution effects, especially with regard to cardiovascular outcomes. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Various kinds of efforts have been devoted to ameliorate the serious volume-expansion effect and low electron conductivity of silicon-based materials in lithium ion batteries. Here, we report a facile high voltage sputtering process to prepare three-dimensional hierarchical porous nitrogen-doped carbon coated Si microsphere to significantly improve the lithium storage performance. The structure and morphology of the as-obtained samples are characterized by X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscope and scanning electron microscope. The results indicate that the as-prepared composite is composed of silicon nanoparticles (similar to 100 nm) coated with conductive thin carbon layer (similar to 8.5 nm). The composite shows excellent lithium storage performance with a reversible capacity of 1565 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles at a current density of 0.5 A g(-1), as well as a long cycling performance at the high current density of 2 A g(-1). The facile preparation process and highly silicon-loading (similar to 78%) makes the prepared material be a great potential application in lithium-ion batteries.

AB In situ gamma-ray spectrometry has since the introduction of portable germanium detectors been a widely used method for the assessment of radionuclide ground deposition activity levels. It is, however, a method that is most often associated with fairly large and, more important, poorly known combined measurement uncertainties. In this work an uncertainty analysis of in situ gamma ray spectrometry in accordance with the Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurements is presented. The uncertainty analysis takes into account uncertainty contributions from the calibration of the detector system, the assumed activity distribution in soil, soil density, detector height and air density. As a result, measurement results from in situ gamma spectrometry will serve as a better basis for decision-making in e.g. radiological emergencies.

AB South Africa has the largest occurrence of the human immune deficiency virus (HIV) in the world but has also implemented the largest antiretroviral (ARV) treatment programme. It was therefore of interest to determine the presence and concentrations of commonly used antiretroviral drugs (ARVDs) and, also, to determine the capabilities of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) for removing ARVDs. To this end, a surrogate standard based LC-MS/MS method was optimized and applied for the detection of thirteen ARVDs used in the treatment and management of HIV/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) in two major and one modular WWTP in the eThekwini Municipality in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. The method was validated and the detection limits fell within the range of 2-20 ng L-1. The analytical recoveries for the ARVDs were mainly greater than 50% with acceptable relative standard deviations. The concentration values ranged from < LOD - 53000 ng L-1 (influent), < LOD - 34000 ng L-1 (effluent) in a decentralized wastewater treatment facility (DEWATS); < LOD - 24000 ng L-1 (influent), < LOD - 33000 ng L-1 (effluent) in Northern WWTP and 61-34000 ng L-1 (influent), < LOD - 20000 ng L-1 (effluent) in Phoenix WWTP. Whilst abacavir, lamivudine and zidovudine were almost completely removed from the effluents, atazanavir, efavirenz, lopinavir and nevirapine persisted in the effluents from all three WWTPs. To estimate the ecotoxicological risks associated with the discharge of ARVDs, a countrywide survey focussing on the occurrence of ARVDs in WWTPs, surface and fresh water bodies, and aquatic organisms, is necessary.

   METAANALYSIS
AB A strong positive association has been observed between circulating anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH), a biomarker of ovarian reserve, and breast cancer risk in three prospective studies. Confirming this association is important because of the paucity of biomarkers of breast cancer risk in premenopausal women. We conducted a consortium study including ten prospective cohorts that had collected blood from premenopausal women. A nested case-control design was implemented within each cohort. A total of 2,835 invasive (80%) and in situ (20%) breast cancer cases were individually matched to controls (n=3,122) on age at blood donation. AMH was measured using a high sensitivity enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay. Conditional logistic regression was applied to the aggregated dataset. There was a statistically significant trend of increasing breast cancer risk with increasing AMH concentration (p(trend) across quartiles <0.0001) after adjusting for breast cancer risk factors. The odds ratio (OR) for breast cancer in the top vs. bottom quartile of AMH was 1.60 (95% CI=1.31-1.94). Though the test for interaction was not statistically significant (p(interaction)=0.15), the trend was statistically significant only for tumors positive for both estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR): ER+/PR+: ORQ4-Q1=1.96, 95% CI=1.46-2.64, p(trend) <0.0001; ER+/PR-: ORQ4-Q1=0.82, 95% CI=0.40-1.68, p(trend)=0.51; ER-/PR+: ORQ4-Q1=3.23, 95% CI=0.48-21.9, p(trend)=0.26; ER-/PR-: ORQ4-Q1=1.15, 95% CI=0.63-2.09, p(trend)=0.60. The association was observed for both pre- (ORQ4-Q1= 1.35, 95% CI=1.05-1.73) and post-menopausal (ORQ4-Q1=1.61, 95% CI=1.03-2.53) breast cancer (p(interaction)=0.34). In this large consortium study, we confirmed that AMH is associated with breast cancer risk, with a 60% increase in risk for women in the top vs. bottom quartile of AMH.
   What's new? To make informed decisions about screening and prevention, women need tools to accurately assess their breast cancer risk. Young women have few predictive biomarkers to look to; estrogen and progesterone are only weakly predictive before menopause. Anti-Muellerian hormone (AMH), which strongly correlates with age at menopause, may also correlate with breast cancer risk, according to some previous data. Here, the authors test this correlation by conducting nested case-control studies within ten different cohorts. They found that breast cancer risk increased along with increasing AMH concentration, confirming this hormone as a possible biomarker for breast cancer.

AB A class of Stieltjes functions of finite type is introduced. These satisfy Widder's conditions on the successive derivatives up to some finite order and are not necessarily smooth. We show that such functions have a unique integral representation along some generic kernel which is a truncated Laurent series approximating the standard Stieltjes kernel. We then obtain a two-to-one correspondence, via the logarithmic derivative, between these functions and a subclass of hyperbolically monotone functions of finite type. This correspondence generalizes a representation of HCM functions in terms of two Stieltjes transforms earlier obtained by the first author.

AB Stream ecological theory predicts that the use of allochthonous resources declines with increasing channel width, while at the same time primary production and autochthonous carbon use by consumers increase. Although these expectations have found support in several studies, it is not well known how terrestrial runoff and/or inputs of primary production from lakes alter these longitudinal patterns. To investigate this, we analyzed the diet of filter-feeding black fly and caddisfly larvae from 23 boreal streams, encompassing gradients in drainage area, land cover and land use, and distance to nearest upstream lake outlet. In five of these streams, we also sampled repeatedly during autumn to test if allochthony of filter feeders increases over time as new litter inputs are processed. Across sites, filter-feeder autochthony was 21.1-75.1%, did not differ between black fly and caddisfly larvae, was not positively related to drainage area, and did not decrease with distance from lakes. Instead, lake and wetland cover promoted filter-feeder autochthony independently of stream size, whereas catchment-scale forest cover and forestry reduced autochthony. Further, we found no seasonal increase in allochthony, indicating low assimilation of particles derived from autumn litter fall. Hence, catchment properties, rather than local conditions, can influence levels of autochthony in boreal streams.

ID OCCUPANTS PERCEPTION; NOISE; FLOOR; DWELLINGS; PROPOSAL
AB There is a need to develop single number quantities (SNQ) of impact sound insulation that correlate better with walking sound annoyance. Previous research has indicated that impact sound insulation should be evaluated from 20 Hz in lightweight constructions, using modified spectrum adaptation terms. The purpose of our study was to verify whether frequencies between 20 and 50 Hz are important for perceived walking sound annoyance and to verify whether the proposed spectrum adaptation terms improve correlation with perceived walking sound annoyance. Binaural recordings of walking sound in one heavy and one lightweight construction were evaluated in a two-part listening test. The need to include frequencies from 20 Hz when evaluating lightweight constructions was verified. Both tested constructions achieved similar performance in terms of L-nT,L-w and L-nT,L-w C1.50-2500, while a significant mismatch in the rated annoyance was observed. The correlation between SNQ and subjective response was considerably improved, when the impact sound insulation was evaluated from 20 or 25 Hz using a flat frequency-weighting factor.

AB The support materials Al2O3, SiO2 and TiO2 were modified with 16 wt% CeO2, using two different preparation methods evaporation-impregnation and precipitation-deposition. The synthesized 16 wt% CeO2-Al2O3, 16 wt% CeO2-SiO2 and 16 wt% CeO2-TiO2 materials were characterized by means of X-ray powder diffraction for the phase purity, scanning electron microscopy for the morphology, nitrogen physisorption to determine the specific surface area and X-ray photo electron spectroscopy for the oxidation state of the Ce in the TiO2, Al2O3 and SiO2 matrices. Transmission electron microscopy was used to study the particle size of CeO2 whereas CO2-temperature programmed desorption (TPD) was used to determine the basicity of ceria-modified TiO2, Al2O3 and SiO2 catalysts. Furthermore, the catalytic performance of the as prepared CeO2-modified catalysts were compared in the synthesis of diethyl carbonate starting from ethanol and CO2 using butylene oxide as the dehydrating agent. The physico-chemical characterization results were correlated with the catalytic activity results and discussed in detail. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A novel strategy for discriminating genuine and adulterated marine oils is proposed. The strategy consists of i) determining the stereospecific distribution (sn-1, sn-2 and sn-3) of omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (omega-3 PUFA) on the backbone of triacylglycerols by using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry; ii) transforming the qualitative stereospecific information into quantitative data by means of a novel strategy; iii) analyzing the transformed data by principal component analysis. The proposed strategy was tested on pure oils (seal, salmon, cod liver, sandeel, blue whiting, herring), a mixture of blue whiting, herring, sandeel and Norway pout and some intentionally adulterated oils. In addition, some published krill oil data were analyzed to confirm the reliability of the new approach.

AB Diet shifts are common in mammals and birds, but little is known about how such shifts along the food web affect contaminant exposure. Voles are staple food for many mammalian and avian predators. There is therefore a risk of transfer of contaminants accumulated in voles within the food chain. Osmium is one of the rarest earth elements with osmium tetroxide (OsO4 ) as the most toxic vapor-phase airborne contaminant. Anthropogenic OsO4 accumulates in fruticose lichens that are important winter food of bank voles (Myodes glareolus). Here, we test if a) anthropogenic osmium accumulates in bank voles in winter, and b) accumulation rates and concentrations are lower in autumn when the species is mainly herbivorous. Our study, performed in a boreal forest impacted by anthropogenic osmium, supported the hypotheses for all studied tissues (kidney, liver, lung, muscle and spleen) in 50 studied bank voles. In autumn, osmium concentrations in bank voles were even partly similar to those in the graminivorous field vole (Microtus agrestis: n = 14). In autumn but not in late winter/early spring, osmium concentrations were generally negatively correlated with body weight and root length of the first mandible molar, i.e. proxies of bank vole age. Identified negative correlations between organ-to-body weight ratios and osmium concentrations in late winter/early spring indicate intoxication. Our results suggest unequal accumulation risk for predators feeding on different cohorts of bank voles. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

ID CAUSAL MEDIATION ANALYSIS; BIAS FORMULAS; STROKE CARE; RIKS-STROKE;

AB To estimate direct and indirect effects of an exposure on an outcome from observed data, strong assumptions about unconfoundedness are required. Since these assumptions cannot be tested using the observed data, a mediation analysis should always be accompanied by a sensitivity analysis of the resulting estimates. In this article, we propose a sensitivity analysis method for parametric estimation of direct and indirect effects when the exposure, mediator, and outcome are all binary. The sensitivity parameters consist of the correlations between the error terms of the exposure, mediator, and outcome models. These correlations are incorporated into the estimation of the model parameters and identification sets are then obtained for the direct and indirect effects for a range of plausible correlation values. We take the sampling variability into account through the construction of uncertainty intervals. The proposed method is able to assess sensitivity to both mediator-outcome confounding and confounding involving the exposure. To illustrate the method, we apply it to a mediation study based on the data from the Swedish Stroke Register (Riksstroke). An R package that implements the proposed method is available.

AB We studied the efficacy and safety of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and tacrolimus as second-line therapy in pediatric patients with autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) who were intolerant or non-responders to standard therapy (corticosteroid and azathioprine).
   We performed a retrospective study of data from 13 centers in Europe, USA, and Canada. Thirty-eight patients (< 18 years old) who received second-line therapy (18 MMF and 20 tacrolimus), for a median of 72 months (range 8-182) were evaluated. Patients were categorized into two groups: Group 1 (n = 17) were intolerant to corticosteroid or azathioprine, and group 2 (n = 21) were non-responders to standard therapy.
   Overall complete response rates were similar in patients treated with MMF and tacrolimus (55.6 vs. 65%, p = 0.552). In group 1, MMF and tacrolimus maintained a biochemical remission in 88.9 and 87.5% of patients, respectively (p = 0.929). More patients in group 2 given tacrolimus compared to MMF had a complete response, but the difference was not statistically significant (50.0 vs. 22.2%, p = 0.195). Biochemical remission was achieved in 71.1% (27/38) of patients by tacrolimus and/or MMF. Decompensated cirrhosis was more commonly seen in MMF and/or tacrolimus non-responders than in responders (45.5 vs. 7.4%, p = 0.006). Five patients who received second-line therapy (2 MMF and 3 tacrolimus) developed side effects that led to therapy withdrawal.
   Long-term therapy with MMF or tacrolimus was generally well tolerated by pediatric patients with AIH. Both MMF and tacrolimus had excellent efficacy in patients intolerant to corticosteroid or azathioprine. Tacrolimus might be more effective than MMF in patients failing previous therapy.

TI Plant, herbivore and parasitoid community composition in native

AB 1. Converting natural areas into land used for production causes dramatic changes in the configuration of landscapes. Both the loss and fragmentation of native habitats contribute to biodiversity loss world-wide and the consequent creation of artificial edges can have a significant influence on community assembly. The conservation value of plantation forests has been identified for specific species, but it is not clear whether exotic pine plantations can also be used for the preservation of native communities in general.
   2. We studied whether community composition of different trophic levels (plants, herbivorous caterpillars, parasitoids) changed across native Nothofagaceae forests to exotic pine plantations, and whether habitat edges affected communities differently depending on the forest type considered. To accomplish this, we sampled plants, herbivorous caterpillars and parasitoids in native Nothofagaceae and exotic pine plantation forests and compared community composition of each trophic level across habitats.
   3. We found that community composition of plants, herbivorous caterpillars and parasitoids differed significantly between native and exotic plantation forests, and that variation in the composition of the upper trophic levels was strongly dependent on variation in the composition of the lower trophic level. Moreover, differences in community composition were mostly the result of species turnover, suggesting that plantations are complementary habitats for some species, but cannot be a substitute habitat for all native forest species. Furthermore, edge effects had a strong impact on the composition of native communities, such that certain species were only present in the interior of the native habitat.
   4. Synthesis and applications. Large areas of native vegetation, where the interior remains intact, are essential to preserve species that are susceptible to edge effects and that cannot occupy other habitat types. Creating straight instead of winding edges could decrease the impact that plantations have on native forests. Furthermore, increasing the representativeness of native plant communities in exotic plantation forests would cascade up to higher consumer trophic levels, considerably increasing the conservation value of these commercial stands.

AB Elevated atmospheric input of nitrogen (N) is currently affecting plant biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. The growth and survival of numerous plant species is known to respond strongly to N fertilisation. Yet, few studies have assessed the effects of N deposition on seed quality and reproductive performance, which is an important life-history stage of plants. Here we address this knowledge gap by assessing the effects of atmospheric N deposition on seed quality of the ancient forest herb Anemone nemorosa using two complementary approaches. By taking advantage of the wide spatiotemporal variation in N deposition rates in pan-European temperate and boreal forests over 2years, we detected positive effects of N deposition on the N concentration (percentage N per unit seed mass, increased from 2.8% to 4.1%) and N content (total N mass per seed more than doubled) of A.nemorosa seeds. In a complementary experiment, we applied ammonium nitrate to aboveground plant tissues and the soil surface to determine whether dissolved N sources in precipitation could be incorporated into seeds. Although the addition of N to leaves and the soil surface had no effect, a concentrated N solution applied to petals during anthesis resulted in increased seed mass, seed N concentration and N content. Our results demonstrate that N deposition on the petals enhances bioaccumulation of N in the seeds of A.nemorosa. Enhanced atmospheric inputs of N can thus not only affect growth and population dynamics via root or canopy uptake, but can also influence seed quality and reproduction via intake through the inflorescences.

AB The phytohormone ethylene impacts secondary stem growth in plants by stimulating cambial activity, xylem development and fiber over vessel formation. We report the effect of ethylene on secondary cell wall formation and the molecular connection between ethylene signaling and wood formation.
   We applied exogenous ethylene or its precursor 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) to wild-type and ethylene-insensitive hybrid aspen trees (Populus tremulaxtremuloides) and studied secondary cell wall anatomy, chemistry and ultrastructure. We furthermore analyzed the transcriptome (RNA Seq) after ACC application to wild-type and ethylene-insensitive trees.
   We demonstrate that ACC and ethylene induce gelatinous layers (G-layers) and alter the fiber cell wall cellulose microfibril angle. G-layers are tertiary wall layers rich in cellulose, typically found in tension wood of aspen trees. A vast majority of transcripts affected by ACC are downstream of ethylene perception and include a large number of transcription factors (TFs). Motif-analyses reveal potential connections between ethylene TFs (Ethylene Response Factors (ERFs), ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE 3/ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE3-LIKE1 (EIN3/EIL1)) and wood formation.
   G-layer formation upon ethylene application suggests that the increase in ethylene biosynthesis observed during tension wood formation is important for its formation. Ethylene-regulated TFs of the ERF and EIN3/EIL1 type could transmit the ethylene signal.

AB Metacaspases are a subgroup of caspase homologues represented in bacteria, algae and plants. Although type I and type II metacaspases are present in plants, recently discovered and uncharacterized type III metacaspases can only be found in algae which have undergone secondary endosymbiosis.
   We analysed the expression levels of all 13 caspase homologues in the cryptophyte Guillardia theta invivo and biochemically characterized its only type III metacaspase, GtMC2, invitro.
   Type III metacaspase GtMC2 was shown to be an endopeptidase with a preference for basic amino acids in the P1 position, which exhibited specific N-terminal proteolytic cleavage for full catalytic efficiency. Autolytic processing, as well as the activity of the mature enzyme, required the presence of calcium ions in low millimolar concentrations. In GtMC2, two calcium-binding sites were identified, one with a dissociation constant at low and the other at high micromolar concentrations.
   We show high functional relatedness of type III metacaspases to type I metacaspases. Moreover, our data suggest that the low-affinity calcium-binding site is located in the p10 domain, which contains a well-conserved N-terminal region. This region can only be found in type I/II/III metacaspases, but is absent in calcium-independent caspase homologues.

AB To identify factors associated with timing of stoma reversal after rectal cancer surgery in a large Swedish register-based cohort.
   Three thousand five hundred sixty-four patients with rectal cancer who received a protective stoma during surgery in 2007-2013 were identified in the Swedish colorectal cancer register. Time to stoma reversal was evaluated over a follow-up period of one and a half years. Factors associated with timing of stoma reversal were analysed using Cox regression analysis. Reversal within 9 months (12 months if adjuvant chemotherapy) was considered latest expected time to closure.
   Stoma reversal was performed in 2954 (82.9%) patients during follow-up. Patients with post-secondary education had an increased chance for early stoma reversal (HR 1.13; 95% CI 1.02-1.25). Postoperative complications (0.67; 0.62-0.73), adjuvant chemotherapy (0.63; 0.57-0.69), more advanced cancer stage (stage III 0.74; 0.66-0.83 and stage IV 0.38; 0.32-0.46) and higher ASA score (0.80; 0.71-0.90 for ASA 3-4) were associated with longer time to reversal. Two thousand four hundred thirty-seven (68.4%) patients had stoma reversal within latest expected time to closure. Factors associated to decreased chance of timely reversal were more advanced cancer stage (stage III 0.64; 0.50-0.81 and stage IV 0.19; 0.13-0.27), postoperative complications (0.50; 0.42-0.59) and higher ASA score (0.77; 0.61-0.96 for ASA 3-4).
   Patients with a high level of education had a higher chance of timely reversal but medical factors had a stronger association to time to reversal. Patients with advanced rectal cancer are at high risk for non-reversal and should be considered for permanent stoma.

AB Keshan disease (KD) is an endemic cardiomyopathy with high mortality. Selenium (Se) and zinc (Zn) deficiencies are closely related to KD. The molecular mechanism of KD pathogenesis is still unclear. There are only few studies on the interaction of trace elements and proteins associated with the pathogenesis of KD. In this study, isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ)-coupled two-dimensional liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (2DLC-MS/MS) technique analysis was used to analyze the differential expression of proteins from serum samples. Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD) was used to screen Se- and Zn-associated proteins. Then, pathway and network analyses of Se- and Zn-associated proteins were constituted by Cytoscape ClueGO and GeneMANIA plugins. One hundred and five differentially expressed proteins were obtained by 2DLC-MS/MS, among them 19 Se- and 3 Zn-associated proteins. Fifty-two pathways were identified from ClueGO and 1 network from GeneMANIA analyses. The results showed that Se-associated proteins STAT3 and MAPK1 and Zn-associated proteins HIF1A and PARP1, the proteins involved in HIF-1 signaling pathway and apoptosis pathway, may play significant roles in the pathogenesis of KD.

TI Influence of allochthonous dissolved organic matter on pelagic basal

AB Phytoplankton and heterotrophic bacteria are key groups at the base of aquatic food webs. In estuaries receiving riverine water with a high content of coloured allochthonous dissolved organic matter (ADOM), phytoplankton primary production may be reduced, while bacterial production is favoured. We tested this hypothesis by performing a field study in a northerly estuary receiving nutrient-poor, ADOM-rich riverine water, and analyzing results using multivariate statistics. Throughout the productive season, and especially during the spring river flush, the production and growth rate of heterotrophic bacteria were stimulated by the riverine inflow of dissolved organic carbon (DOC). In contrast, primary production and photosynthetic efficiency (i.e. phytoplankton growth rate) were negatively affected by DOC. Primary production related positively to phosphorus, which is the limiting nutrient in the area. In the upper estuary where DOC concentrations were the highest, the heterotrophic bacterial production constituted almost 100% of the basal production (sum of primary and bacterial production) during spring, while during summer the primary and bacterial production were approximately equal. Our study shows that riverine DOC had a strong negative influence on coastal phytoplankton production, likely due to light attenuation. On the other hand DOC showed a positive influence on bacterial production since it represents a supplementary food source. Thus, in boreal regions where climate change will cause increased river inflow to coastal waters, the balance between phytoplankton and bacterial production is likely to be changed, favouring bacteria. The pelagic food web structure and overall productivity will in turn be altered. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Evidence-based guidelines on the management of pancreatic cystic neoplasms (PCN) are lacking. This guideline is a joint initiative of the European Study Group on Cystic Tumours of the Pancreas, United European Gastroenterology, European Pancreatic Club, European-African Hepato-Pancreato-Biliary Association, European Digestive Surgery, and the European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy. It replaces the 2013 European consensus statement guidelines on PCN. European and non-European experts performed systematic reviews and used GRADE methodology to answer relevant clinical questions on nine topics (biomarkers, radiology, endoscopy, intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN), mucinous cystic neoplasm (MCN), serous cystic neoplasm, rare cysts, (neo)adjuvant treatment, and pathology). Recommendations include conservative management, relative and absolute indications for surgery. A conservative approach is recommended for asymptomatic MCN and IPMN measuring < 40 mm without an enhancing nodule. Relative indications for surgery in IPMN include a main pancreatic duct (MPD) diameter between 5 and 9.9 mm or a cyst diameter >= 40 mm. Absolute indications for surgery in IPMN, due to the high-risk of malignant transformation, include jaundice, an enhancing mural nodule > 5 mm, and MPD diameter > 10 mm. Lifelong follow-up of IPMN is recommended in patients who are fit for surgery. The European evidence-based guidelines on PCN aim to improve the diagnosis and management of PCN.

AB The default mode network (DMN) involves interacting cortical areas, including the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and the retrosplenial cortex (RSC), and subcortical areas, including the medial temporal lobe (MTL). The degree of functional connectivity (FC) within the DMN, particularly between MTL and medial-parietal subsystems, relates to episodic memory (EM) processes. However, past resting-state studies investigating the link between posterior DMN-MTL FC and EM performance yielded inconsistent results, possibly reflecting heterogeneity in the degree of connectivity between MTL and specific cortical DMN regions. Animal work suggests that RSC has structural connections to both cortical DMN regions and MTL, and may thus serve as an intermediate layer that facilitates information transfer between cortical and subcortical DMNs. We studied 180 healthy old adults (aged 64-68 years), who underwent comprehensive assessment of EM, along with resting-state fMRI. We found greater FC between MTL and RSC than between MTL and the other cortical DMN regions (e.g., PCC), with the only significant association with EM observed for MTL-RSC FC. Mediational analysis showed that MTL-cortical DMN connectivity increased with RSC as a mediator. Further analysis using a graph-theoretical approach on DMN nodes revealed the highest betweenness centrality for RSC, confirming that a high proportion of short paths among DMN regions pass through RSC. Importantly, the degree of RSC mediation was associated with EM performance, suggesting that individuals with greater mediation have an EM advantage. These findings suggest that RSC forms a critical gateway between MTL and cortical DMN to support EM in older adults.

AB A cryopreservation method was developed for a Norway spruce (Picea abies L. Karst.) cell line characterised by highly vacuolated cells and ability to produce natural-like extracellular lignin in a cell suspension culture. Spruce callus cultured in a photoperiod of 16 h light, 8 h dark contained two types of callus morphologies. Soft callus was composed of loosely bound cells that dispersed into single cells and small cell aggregates when transferred into liquid medium. The callus with hard morphology had also cells that were more tightly attached to each other; this callus formed bigger cell aggregates in liquid medium in addition to single cells and small cell aggregates. The hard callus contained higher concentration of intracellular phenolic compounds as compared to soft callus. For cryopreservation, a vitrification method with plant vitrification solution 2 (PVS2) was used. To reduce cellular water content, spruce calli were pre-cultured on a culture medium with increasing sucrose concentration (0.2 and 0.4 M; one day on each). The cryopreservation survival rate of callus with hard morphology was significantly higher than that with soft morphology (45 +/- 8% and 5 +/- 5%, respectively). Pre-culturing in continuous light for several weeks led exclusively to formation of a hard-type callus, which had a survival rate of 48 +/- 16% in cryopreservation. Expression of candidate genes of the monolignol biosynthesis pathway, Fourier transform infrared spectra and pyrolysis breakdown products of extracellular lignin were similar in control cultures and those originating from cryopreserved cells suggesting that cryopreservation is a feasible method for long-term storage of the lignin-forming cell line.

AB Study aim: Retrospective studies have demonstrated a worse outcome in breast cancer patients not developing leukopenia during adjuvant chemotherapy. The SBG 2000-1 is the first randomised trial designed to compare individually dosed chemotherapy without G-CSF support based on grade of toxicity to standard-dosed chemotherapy based on body surface area (BSA).
   Methods: Patients with early breast cancer were included and received the first cycle of standard FEC (fluorouracil 600 mg/m(2), epirubicin 60 mg/m(2), cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2). Patients with nadir leukopenia grade 0-2 after first cycle were randomised between either 6 additional courses of tailored FEC with increased doses (E 75-90 mg/m(2), C 900-1200 mg/m(2)) or fixed treatment with 6 standard FEC. Patients with grade 3-4 leukopenia were registered and treated with 6 standard FEC. Primary end-point was distant disease-free survival (DDFS).
   Results: The study enrolled 1535 patients, of which 1052 patients were randomised to tailored FEC (N = 524) or standard FEC (N = 528), whereas 401 patients with leukopenia grade 3-4 continued standard FEC and formed the registered cohort. Dose escalation did not statistically significantly improve 10-year DDFS (79% and 77%, HR 0.87, CI 0.67-1.14, P = 0.32) or OS (82% and 78%, respectively, HR 0.89, CI 0.57e1.16, P = 0.38). Corresponding estimates for the registered group of patients were DDFS 79% and OS 82%, respectively.
   Conclusions: The SBG 2000-1 study failed to show a statistically significant improvement of escalated and tailored-dosed chemotherapy compared with standard BSA-based chemotherapy in patients with low haematological toxicity, although all efficacy parameters showed a numerical advantage for tailored treatment.

AB ObjectiveTo date, no longitudinal, community-based studies have examined the association between disordered eating emerging in adolescence and long-term physical well-being. This study sought to explore the longitudinal associations between risk for restrictive disordered eating (DE-R; those not presenting with binge-purge symptoms) in adolescence and trajectories of functional somatic symptoms (FSS) and body mass index (BMI), and several indicators of poor physical well-being across early- to mid-adulthood, including medication, number of doctor visits, and sick leave.
   DesignData were obtained from the Northern Swedish Cohort Study (N=1,001), a prospective longitudinal study including four time points from age 16 to 42years.
   MethodsA cumulative measure of DE-R risk was computed. Latent class growth analysis was used to identify subpopulation trajectories of FSS and BMI. The three-step method for auxiliary variables and logistic regressions were used to assess associations between DE-R and the trajectory classes as well as indicators of poorphysical well-being.
   ResultsThree trajectories were identified for FSS. A gender by BMI interaction led to a classification of four BMI trajectories in men, but three in women. The presence of DE-R risk in adolescence increased odds of unfavourable FSS development, increasing BMI in women, and continually low BMI in men. Indicators of poor physical well-being at ages 21, 30, and 42years were associated with DE-R risk in adolescence.
   ConclusionsData spanning nearly three decades suggest that physical well-being impairment is related to DE-R risk measured earlier in life, underscoring the urgency for targeted, gender-sensitive preventive interventions for teenagers.
   What is already known on this subject?
   Disordered eating is linked to poor physical and mental well-being and quality of life. No longitudinal studies have examined long-term physical well-being consequences of adolescent disordered eating risk.
   What does this study add?
   Non-purging disordered eating symptoms in adolescence predict adverse physical well-being outcomes in middle-aged men and women. Targeted interventions and preventative work during adolescence are needed.

AB Objective:To estimate the effect of antihypertensive treatment in trials with baseline normotension and low levels of previous cardiovascular disease. To test if the results from SPRINT are compatible with those from other trials, and test the impact of SPRINT results on overall effect estimates.Methods:Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials with at least 1000 patient-years of follow-up, comparing antihypertensive treatment versus placebo, or different blood pressure goals against each other. Trials with at least 50% previous cardiovascular disease were excluded.Results:Sixteen trials, including 66816 participants, were included in the meta-analyses. Mean baseline SBP was 138mmHg, and mean difference between treatment arms was 5.5mmHg. Antihypertensive treatment was associated with a neutral effect on all-cause mortality [relative risk 0.98, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.92-1.05] and major cardiovascular events (0.97, 0.91-1.03). Results from SPRINT differed significantly from those of other trials (P=0.012 for all-cause mortality; P=0.016 for major cardiovascular events), but overall effect estimates were similar when SPRINT was excluded (1.01, 0.95-1.06 for all-cause mortality; 0.98, 0.93-1.03 for major cardiovascular events). Treatment was associated with reduced risk of secondary outcomes stroke (0.84, 0.71-1.00) and heart failure (0.88, 0.78-0.98), although heterogeneity was high in the stroke analysis (I-2=54%).Conclusion:SPRINT results are not representative for trials with baseline normotension and low levels of previous cardiovascular disease. Antihypertensive treatment does not protect against death or major cardiovascular events in this setting.

AB Plant-microbial feedbacks are important drivers of plant community structure and dynamics. These feedbacks are driven by the variable modification of soil microbial communities by different plant species. However, other factors besides plant species can influence soil communities and potentially interact with plant-microbial feedbacks. We tested for plant-microbial feedbacks in two Eucalyptus species, E. globulus and E. obliqua, and the influence of forest fire on these feedbacks. We collected soils from beneath mature trees of both species within native forest stands on the Forestier Peninsula, Tasmania, Australia, that had or had not been burnt by a recent forest fire. These soils were subsequently used to inoculate seedlings of both species in a glasshouse experiment. We hypothesized that (i) eucalypt seedlings would respond differently to inoculation with conspecific versus heterospecific soils (i.e., exhibit plant-microbial feedbacks) and (ii) these feedbacks would be removed by forest fire. For each species, linear mixed effects models tested for differences in seedling survival and biomass in response to inoculation with conspecific versus heterospecific soils that had been collected from either unburnt or burnt stands. Eucalyptus globulus displayed a response consistent with a positive plant-microbial feedback, where seedlings performed better when inoculated with conspecific versus heterospecific soils. However, this effect was only present when seedlings were inoculated with unburnt soils, suggesting that fire removed the positive effect of E. globulus inoculum. These findings show that external environmental factors can interact with plant-microbial feedbacks, with possible implications for plant community structure and dynamics.

AB Pretreatment of anaerobic digester samples by hydrochloric acid (HCl) resulted in removal of Fe-based mineral and coordination compounds, attenuating their interferences with solution-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopic characterization of the solid phase organic matter. Substrate (influent) and digestate (effluent) samples from two full-scale anaerobic digesters, designated CD (co-digester) and SSD (sewage sludge digester), were investigated. Pretreatment of CD samples with 0.2-2.0 mol l(-1) HCl and pretreatment of SSD samples with 1.0-3.0 mol l(-1) HCl removed 96-100% and 76-80% of total Fe, respectively. Pretreatment declined overall paramagnetic characteristics of digestate samples, manifested by 50% (CD) and 70% (SSD) decrease in electron paramagnetic resonance signal intensities. As a result, meaningful solution-state H-1,C-13 heteronuclear single quantum coherence and H-1 NMR spectra of DMSO-d(6) soluble organic matter could be acquired. Sample pretreatment with the lowest concentration of HCl resulted in alteration of C:N ratios in solid phase, likely due to removal of labile organic and inorganic C- and N-containing compounds, while elevating the HCl concentration did not further change the C:N ratios. Furthermore, sample pretreatment increased the solubility of carbohydrates and proteins in DMSO-d(6), enabling the detection of NMR resonances from certain structural units of carbohydrates (e.g. anomeric O2CH) and proteins (e.g. CH alpha in amino acids). Both attenuation of the paramagnetic matrix as well as art enhanced solubility of carbohydrate and protein fractions of the samples in DMSO-d(6) solvent contributed to an improved molecular characterization of anaerobic digester samples by solution-state NMR analysis.

AB Background: Adolescent anxiety and depression are highly prevalent psychiatric disorders that are associated with altered molecular and neurocircuit profiles. Recently, increased mitochondrial DNA copy number (mtDNAcn) has been found to be associated with several psychopathologies in adults, especially anxiety and depression. The associations between mtDNA-cn and anxiety and depression have not, however, been investigated in adolescents. Moreover, to date there have been no studies examining associations between mtDNA-cn and brain network alterations in mood disorders in any age group.
   Methods: The first aim of this study was to compare salivary mtDNA-cn between 49 depressed and/or anxious adolescents and 35 well-matched healthy controls. The second aim of this study was to identify neural correlates of mtDNA-cn derived from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and tractography, in the full sample of adolescents.
   Results: There were no diagnosis-specific alterations in mtDNA-cn. However, there was a positive correlation between mtDNA-cn and levels of anxiety, but not depression, in the full sample of adolescents. A subnetwork of connections largely corresponding to the left fronto-occipital fasciculus had significantly lower fractional anisotropy (FA) values in adolescents with higher than median mtDNA-cn.
   Limitations: Undifferentiated analysis of free and intracellular mtDNA and use of DTI-based tractography represent this study's limitations.
   Conclusions: The results of this study help elucidate the relationships between clinical symptoms, molecular changes, and neurocircuitry alterations in adolescents with and without anxiety and depression, and they suggest that increased mtDNA-cn is associated both with increased anxiety symptoms and with decreased frontooccipital structural connectivity in this population.

AB Partial solution variant of the cyclic reduction (PSCR) method is a direct solver that can be applied to certain types of separable block tridiagonal linear systems. Such linear systems arise, e.g., from the Poisson and the Helmholtz equations discretized with bilinear finite-elements. Furthermore, the separability of the linear system entails that the discretization domain has to be rectangular and the discretization mesh orthogonal. A generalized graphics processing unit (GPU) implementation of the PSCR method is presented. The numerical results indicate up to 24-fold speedups when compared to an equivalent CPU implementation that utilizes a single CPU core. Attained floating point performance is analyzed using roofline performance analysis model and the resulting models show that the attained floating point performance is mainly limited by the off-chip memory bandwidth and the effectiveness of a tridiagonal solver used to solve arising tridiagonal subproblems. The performance is accelerated using off-line autotuning techniques. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The fate of fourteen target perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are described within a small stream affected by a sewage treatment plant (STP) effluent. Concentrations of target PFASs in samples of water, benthic macroinvertebrates and brown trout (Salmo trutta) are presented. Two hundred brown trout individuals originating from clean sites within the same stream were tagged and stocked into an experimental site affected by the STP's effluent. As a passive sampling approach, polar organic chemical integrative samplers (POCIS) were deployed in the water to reveal the water-macroinvertebrates-fish biotransformation processes of PFASs. Bioconcentration/bioaccumulation of target compounds was monitored one, three, and six months after stocking. Twelve of the fourteen target PFASs were found in concentration above the LOQ in at least one of the studied matrices. The compound pattern varied significantly between both the studied species and water samples. Concerning the accumulation of PFASs in fish, the highest concentrations were found in the liver of individuals sampled after three months of exposure. These concentrations rapidly decreased after six months although the water concentrations were slightly increasing during experiment. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB BackgroundTransforming growth factor (TGF) functions as a double-edged sword in prostate cancer tumorigenesis. In initial stages of the disease, TGF acts as a growth inhibitor upon tumor cells, whereas it in later stages of disease rather promotes invasion and metastatic potential. One well-known cellular source of TGF in the bone metastatic site is the bone-forming osteoblasts. Here we have studied the effects by osteoblast-derived factors on metastatic potential in several human prostate cancer cell lines.
   MethodsEffects on metastatic potential in prostate cancer cells by osteoblast-derived factors were studied in vitro using several methods, including Transwell migration and evaluation of formation of pro-migratory protrusions. Confocal microscopy was used to evaluate possible changes in differentiation state in tumor cells by analysis of markers for epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). The Matrigel-on-top 3D culture method was used for further assessment of metastatic characteristics in tumor cells by analysis of formation of filopodium-like protrusions (FLPs).
   ResultsOsteoblast-derived factors increased migration of PC-3U cells, an effect less prominent in cells overexpressing a mutated type I TGF receptor (TRI) preventing non-canonical TRAF6-dependent TGF signaling. Osteoblast-derived factors also increased the formation of long protrusions and loss of cell-cell contacts in PC-3U cells, suggesting induction of a more aggressive phenotype. In addition, treatment with TGF or osteoblast-derived factors of PC-3U cells in Matrigel-on-top 3D cultures promoted formation of FLPs, previously shown to be essential for metastatic establishment.
   ConclusionsThese findings suggests that factors secreted from osteoblasts, including TGF, can induce several cellular traits involved in metastatic potential of PC-3U cells, further strengthening the role for bone cells to promote metastatic tumor cell behavior.

AB Tundra soils account for 50% of global stocks of soil organic carbon (SOC), and it is expected that the amplified climate warming in high latitude could cause loss of this SOC through decomposition. Decomposed SOC could become hydrologically accessible, which increase downstream dissolved organic carbon (DOC) export and subsequent carbon release to the atmosphere, constituting a positive feedback to climate warming. However, DOC export is often neglected in ecosystem models. In this paper, we incorporate processes related to DOC production, mineralization, diffusion, sorption-desorption, and leaching into a customized arctic version of the dynamic ecosystem model LPJ-GUESS in order to mechanistically model catchment DOC export, and to link this flux to other ecosystem processes. The extended LPJ-GUESS is compared to observed DOC export at Stordalen catchment in northern Sweden. Vegetation communities include flood-tolerant graminoids (Eriophorum) and Sphagnum moss, birch forest and dwarf shrub communities. The processes, sorption-desorption and microbial decomposition (DOC production and mineralization) are found to contribute most to the variance in DOC export based on a detailed variance-based Sobol sensitivity analysis (SA) at grid cell-level. Catchment-level SA shows that the highest mean DOC exports come from the Eriophorum peatland (fen). A comparison with observations shows that the model captures the seasonality of DOC fluxes. Two catchment simulations, one without water lateral routing and one without peatland processes, were compared with the catchment simulations with all processes. The comparison showed that the current implementation of catchment lateral flow and peatland processes in LPJ-GUESS are essential to capture catchment-level DOC dynamics and indicate the model is at an appropriate level of complexity to represent the main mechanism of DOC dynamics in soils. The extended model provides a new tool to investigate potential interactions among climate change, vegetation dynamics, soil hydrology and DOC dynamics at both stand-alone to catchment scales.

AB The present work considers a simple model of a durable commodity market involving two agents who trade stocks of two different types. Stock commodities, in contrast to flow commodities, remain on the market from period to period and, consequently, there is neither unique demand function nor unique supply function exists. We also set up exact conditions for trade at disequilibrium, the issue being usually neglected, though a fact of reality. The induced iterative system has infinite number of fixed points and path dependent dynamics. We show that a typical orbit is either attracted to one of the fixed points or eventually sticks at a no-trade point. For the latter the stock distribution always remains the same while the price displays periodic or chaotic oscillations. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB It is well known that when a short laser pulse propagates in an underdense plasma, it induces longitudinal plasma oscillations at the plasma frequency after the pulse, typically referred to as the wakefield. However, for plasma densities approaching the critical density, wakefield generation is suppressed, and instead the EM-pulse (electromagnetic pulse) undergoes nonlinear self-modulation. In this article we have studied the transition from the wakefield generation to formation of quasi-solitons as the plasma density is increased. For this purpose we have applied a one-dimensional relativistic cold fluid model, which has also been compared with particle-in-cell simulations. A key result is that the energy loss of the EM-pulse due to wakefield generation has its maximum for a plasma density of the order 10% of the critical density, but that wakefield generation is sharply suppressed when the density is increased further.

AB Due to vertically thermal stratification in indoor spaces, the cooling load calculation is always a challenge in the design of stratified air distribution systems (STRAD), which in turn is crucial to determine the supply air flow rate and the cooling load to be removed by the air conditioning system. In this paper, several cooling load calculation methods, developed in the past 20 years and focused on STRAD systems, were briefly reviewed. It attempts to clarify these methods in terms of their advantages, limitations and suitable ranges of applications. Furthermore, series of numerical simulations with a total number of 56 cases were conducted, and the applications of a novel cooling load calculation method in STRAD systems were investigated. The reliability of the method was validated for STRAD systems with separated locations of return and exhaust grilles, when adopted in three typical spaces with different building heights, namely a small office, a large terraced classroom and a terminal building. Databases of effective cooling load factors (ECLF;) for different heat sources distributed in the three spaces were obtained and presented, which can be conveniently used to calculate cooling loads. In addition, the influences of return grill height on the occupied zone cooling load as well as the energy saving potentials of STRAD systems were also clarified. The results presented in this paper are helpful for the design and optimization of STRAD systems. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The excitatory synapses of the rat deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN) were quantitatively analyzed by vesicular glutamate transporter 1 and 2 (vGluT1 and vGluT2) immunolabeling. We calculated the number and sizes of the labeled boutons and compared them between lateral/dentate nucleus (LN/DN), posterior interposed nucleus (PIN), anterior interposed nucleus (AIN), and medial nucleus (MN). The density of vGluT1+ boutons differs significantly within these nuclei. In contrast, the vGluT2+ bouton density is more similar between different nuclei. The phylogenetically newer DCN (LN/DN and PIN) have a 39% higher density of vGluT1+ boutons than the phylogenetically older DCN (AIN and MN). The volume of vGluT1+ boutons does not differ between the DCN, however the average volume of vGluT2+ boutons is larger in MN. In summary, our current results confirm and extend our previous findings showing that the increase in dendritic and axonal wiring in phylogenetically newer DCN is associated with an increase in vGluT1+ bouton density.

AB The fractionation factor in the magnesium-isotope fractionation between aqueous solutions of magnesium and brucite changes sign with increasing temperature, as uncovered by recent experiments. To understand this behavior, the Reduced Partition Function Ratios and isotopic fractionation factors (Delta Mg-26/24(brucite-Mg(aq))) are calculated using molecular models of aqueous [Mg(OH2)(6)](2+) and the mineral brucite at increasing levels of density functional theory. The calculations were carried out on the [Mg(OH2)(6)](2+)center dot 12H(2)O cluster, along with different Pauling-bond-strength-conserving models of the mineral lattice of brucite. Three conclusions were reached: (i) all levels of theory overestimate < Mg-O > bond distances in the aqua ion complex relative to Tutton's salts; (ii) the calculations predict that brucite at 298.15 K is always enriched in the heavy isotope, in contrast with experimental observations; (iii) the temperature dependencies of Wimpenny et al. (2014) and Li et al. (2014) could only be achieved by fixing the < Mg-O > bond distances in the [Mg(OH2)(6)](2+)center dot 12H(2)O cluster to values close to those observed in crystals that trap the hydrated ion.

AB We report on the temperature, pressure, and time (T, p, and t)-dependent features of thermal conductivity, kappa, of partially ordered, non-equilibrium state of C-60-OG, the orientational glass of Buckminsterfullerene (at T below the orientational freezing temperature T-og) made more unstable (i) by partially depressurizing its high-p formed state to elastically expand it and (ii) by further pressurizing that state to elastically contract it. The sub-T-og effects observed on heating of C-60-OG differ from those of glasses because phonon propagation depends on the ratio of two well-defined orientational states of C-60 molecules and the density of the solid. A broad peak-like feature appears at T near T-og in the kappa-T plots of C-60-OG formed at 0.7 GPa, depressurized to 0.2 GPa and heated at 0.2 GPa, which we attribute to partial overlap of the sub-T-og and T-og features. A sub-T-og local minimum appears in the kappa-T plots at T well below T-og of C-60-OG formed at 0.1 GPa, pressurized to 0.5 GPa and heated at 0.5 GPa and it corresponds to the state of maximum disorder. Although Buckminsterfullerene is regarded as an orientationally disordered crystal, variation of its properties with T and p is qualitatively different from other such crystals. We discuss the findings in terms of the nature of its disorder, sensitivity of its rotational dynamics to temperature, and the absence of the Johari-Goldstein relaxation. All seem to affect the phenomenology of its glass-like transition. Published by AIP Publishing.

AB Background Low-risk limits recommended for alcohol consumption vary substantially across different national guidelines. To define thresholds associated with lowest risk for all-cause mortality and cardiovascular disease, we studied individual-participant data from 599 912 current drinkers without previous cardiovascular disease.
   Methods We did a combined analysis of individual-participant data from three large-scale data sources in 19 high-income countries (the Emerging Risk Factors Collaboration, EPIC-CVD, and the UK Biobank). We characterised dose-response associations and calculated hazard ratios (HRs) per 100 g per week of alcohol (12.5 units per week) across 83 prospective studies, adjusting at least for study or centre, age, sex, smoking, and diabetes. To be eligible for the analysis, participants had to have information recorded about their alcohol consumption amount and status (ie, non-drinker vs current drinker), plus age, sex, history of diabetes and smoking status, at least 1 year of follow-up after baseline, and no baseline history of cardiovascular disease. The main analyses focused on current drinkers, whose baseline alcohol consumption was categorised into eight predefined groups according to the amount in grams consumed per week. We assessed alcohol consumption in relation to all-cause mortality, total cardiovascular disease, and several cardiovascular disease subtypes. We corrected HRs for estimated long-term variability in alcohol consumption using 152 640 serial alcohol assessments obtained some years apart (median interval 5.6 years [5th-95th percentile 1.04-13.5]) from 71 011 participants from 37 studies.
   Findings In the 599 912 current drinkers included in the analysis, we recorded 40 310 deaths and 39 018 incident cardiovascular disease events during 5.4 million person-years of follow-up. For all-cause mortality, we recorded a positive and curvilinear association with the level of alcohol consumption, with the minimum mortality risk around or below 100 g per week. Alcohol consumption was roughly linearly associated with a higher risk of stroke (HR per 100 g per week higher consumption 1.14, 95% CI, 1.10-1.17), coronary disease excluding myocardial infarction (1.06, 1.00-1.11), heart failure (1.09, 1.03-1.15), fatal hypertensive disease (1.24, 1.15-1.33); and fatal aortic aneurysm (1.15, 1.03-1.28). By contrast, increased alcohol consumption was loglinearly associated with a lower risk of myocardial infarction (HR 0.94, 0.91-0.97). In comparison to those who reported drinking >0-<= 100 g per week, those who reported drinking >100-<= 200 g per week, >200-<= 350 g per week, or >350 g per week had lower life expectancy at age 40 years of approximately 6 months, 1-2 years, or 4-5 years, respectively.
   Interpretation In current drinkers of alcohol in high-income countries, the threshold for lowest risk of all-cause mortality was about 100 g/week. For cardiovascular disease subtypes other than myocardial infarction, there were no clear risk thresholds below which lower alcohol consumption stopped being associated with lower disease risk. These data support limits for alcohol consumption that are lower than those recommended in most current guidelines. Copyright (C) The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Cooperation is ubiquitous in biological and social systems, even though cooperative behavior is often costly and at risk of exploitation by non-cooperators. Several studies have demonstrated that indirect reciprocity, whereby some members of a group observe the behaviors of their peers and use this information to discriminate against previously uncooperative agents in the future, can promote prosocial behavior. Some studies have shown that differential propensities of interacting among and between different types of agents (interaction assortment) can increase the effectiveness of indirect reciprocity. No previous studies have, however, considered differential propensities of observing the behaviors of different types of agents (information assortment). Furthermore, most previous studies have assumed that discriminators possess perfect information about others and incur no costs for gathering and storing this information. Here, we (1) consider both interaction assortment and information assortment, (2) assume discriminators have limited information about others, and (3) introduce a cost for information gathering and storage, in order to understand how the ability of discriminators to stabilize cooperation is affected by these steps toward increased realism. We report the following findings. First, cooperation can persist when agents preferentially interact with agents of other types or when discriminators preferentially observe other discriminators, even when they have limited information. Second, contrary to intuition, increasing the amount of information available to discriminators can exacerbate defection. Third, introducing costs of gathering and storing information makes it more difficult for discriminators to stabilize cooperation. Our study is one of only a few studies to date that show how negative interaction assortment can promote cooperation and broadens the set of circumstances in which it is know that cooperation can be maintained.

SO SCIENCE

ID FLOWERING-LOCUS-T; HYBRID ASPEN; DORMANCY; EXPRESSION; POPLAR
AB In temperate and boreal ecosystems, seasonal cycles of growth and dormancy allow perennial plants to adapt to winter conditions. We show, in hybrid aspen trees, that photoperiodic regulation of dormancy is mechanistically distinct from autumnal growth cessation. Dormancy sets in when symplastic intercellular communication through plasmodesmata is blocked by a process dependent on the phytohormone abscisic acid. The communication blockage prevents growth-promoting signals from accessing the meristem. Thus, precocious growth is disallowed during dormancy. The dormant period, which supports robust survival of the aspen tree in winter, is due to loss of access to growth-promoting signals.

AB Phosphate (P) is an essential macronutrient for plant growth. Roots employ adaptive mechanisms to forage for P in soil. Root hair elongation is particularly important since P is immobile. Here we report that auxin plays a critical role promoting root hair growth in Arabidopsis in response to low external P. Mutants disrupting auxin synthesis (taa1) and transport (aux1) attenuate the low P root hair response. Conversely, targeting AUX1 expression in lateral root cap and epidermal cells rescues this low P response in aux1. Hence auxin transport from the root apex to differentiation zone promotes auxin-dependent hair response to low P. Low external P results in induction of root hair expressed auxin-inducible transcription factors ARF19, RSL2, and RSL4. Mutants lacking these genes disrupt the low P root hair response. We conclude auxin synthesis, transport and response pathway components play critical roles regulating this low P root adaptive response.

AB Root traits such as root angle and hair length influence resource acquisition particularly for immobile nutrients like phosphorus (P). Here, we attempted to modify root angle in rice by disrupting the OsAUX1 auxin influx transporter gene in an effort to improve rice P acquisition efficiency. We show by X-ray microCT imaging that root angle is altered in the osaux1 mutant, causing preferential foraging in the top soil where P normally accumulates, yet surprisingly, P acquisition efficiency does not improve. Through closer investigation, we reveal that OsAUX1 also promotes root hair elongation in response to P limitation. Reporter studies reveal that auxin response increases in the root hair zone in low P environments. We demonstrate that OsAUX1 functions to mobilize auxin from the root apex to the differentiation zone where this signal promotes hair elongation when roots encounter low external P. We conclude that auxin and OsAUX1 play key roles in promoting root foraging for P in rice.

AB The persistence of a stochastic variable is the probability that it does not cross a given level during a fixed time interval. Although persistence is a simple concept to understand, it is in general hard to calculate. Here we consider zero mean Gaussian stationary processes in discrete time n. Few results are known for the persistence P-0(n) in discrete time, except the large time behavior which is characterized by the nontrivial constant theta through P-0(n) similar to theta(n). Using a modified version of the independent interval approximation (IIA) that we developed before, we are able to calculate P-0(n) analytically in z-transform space in terms of the autocorrelation function A(n). If A(n) -> 0 as n -> infinity, we extract theta numerically, while if A(n) = 0, for finite n > N, we find theta exactly (within the IIA). We apply our results to three special cases: the nearest-neighbor-correlated "first order moving average process", where A(n) = 0 for n > 1, the double exponential-correlated "second order autoregressive process", where A(n) = c(1)lambda(n)(1) + c(2)lambda(n)(2), power-law-correlated variables, where A(n) similar to n(-mu). Apart from the power-law case when mu < 5, we find excellent agreement with simulations.

AB Background: The imbalance between proteases and anti-proteases is considered to contribute to the development of COPD. Our aim was to evaluate the protease MMP-9, the antiprotease TIMP-1 and the MMP-9/TIMP-1-ratio as biomarkers in relation to prognosis. Prognosis was assessed as lung function decline and mortality. This was done among subjects with COPD in a population-based cohort.
   Methods: In 2005, clinical examinations including spirometry and peripheral blood sampling, were made in a longitudinal population-based cohort. In total, 1542 individuals participated, whereof 594 with COPD. In 2010, 1031 subjects participated in clinical examinations, and 952 subjects underwent spirometry in both 2005 and 2010. Serum MMP-9 and TIMP-1 concentrations were measured with enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Mortality data were collected from the Swedish national mortality register from the date of examination in 2005 until 31st December 2010.
   Results: The correlation between biomarkers and lung function decline was similar in non-COPD and COPD, but only significant for MMP-9 and MMP-9/TIMP-1-ratio in non-COPD. Mortality was higher in COPD than non-COPD (16% vs. 10%, p = 0.008). MMP-9 concentrations and MMP-9/TIMP-1 ratios in 2005 were higher among those who died during follow up, as well as among those alive but not participating in 2010, when compared to those participating in the 2010-examination. In non-COPD, male sex, age, burden of smoking, heart disease and MMP-9/TIMP-1 ratio were associated with increased risk for death, while increased TIMP-1 was protective. Among those with COPD, age, current smoking, increased MMP-9 and MMP-9/TIMP-1 ratio were associated with an increased risk for death.
   Conclusions: The expected association between these biomarkers and lung function decline in COPD was not confirmed in this population-based study, probably due to a healthy survivor effect. Still, it is suggested that increased proteolytic imbalance may be of greater prognostic importance in COPD than in non-COPD.

AB Background: Trichloramine exposure in indoor swimming pools has been suggested to cause asthma in children. We aimed to investigate the risk of asthma onset among children in relation to individual trichloramine exposure.
   Methods: A longitudinal nested case-control study of 337 children with asthma (cases) and 633 controls aged 1617 years was performed within a population-based cohort from The Obstructive Lung Disease in Northern Sweden studies (OLIN). Year of asthma onset and exposure time at different ages were obtained in telephone interviews. Trichloramine concentrations in the pool buildings were measured. Skin prick test results for inhalant allergens were available from previous examinations of the cohort. The risk for asthma was analyzed in relation to the cumulative trichloramine exposure before onset of asthma.
   Results: The participation rate was high in the original cohort (88 to 96%), and in the case-control study (80%). Trichloramine concentrations ranged from 0.020 to 0.55 mg/m(3) (mean 0.15 mg/m(3)). Swimming pool exposure in early life was associated with a significantly higher risk of pre-school asthma onset. A dose-response relationship between swimming pool exposure and asthma was indicated in children with asthma onset at 1 year of age. Children who were both sensitized and exposed had a particularly high risk.
   Conclusions: Early life exposure to chlorinated swimming pool environments was associated with pre-school asthma onset.

AB Management of forest for wood production has altered ecosystem structures and processes and led to habitat loss and species extinctions, worldwide. Deadwood is a key resource supporting forest biodiversity, and commonly declines following forest management. However, different forest management methods affect dead wood differently. For example, uneven aged silviculture maintains an age-stratified forest with ongoing dead wood production, while even-aged silviculture breaks forest continuity, leading to long periods without large trees. We asked how deadwood-dependent beetles respond to different silvicultural practices and if their responses depend on deadwood volume, and beetles preference for decay stages of deadwood. We compared beetle assemblages in five boreal forest types with different management strategies: clearcutting and thinning (both representing even-aged silviculture), selective felling (representing uneven-aged silviculture), reference and old growth forest (both uneven-aged controls without a recent history [similar to 50 years] of management, but the latter with high conservation values). We collected beetles using window traps and by sieving the bark from experimental logs (bolts). Beetle assemblages on clear-cuts differed from all other stand types, regardless of trapping method or decay stage preference. Thinning differed from reference stands, indicating incomplete recovery after clear-cutting, while selective felling differed only from clear-cuts. In contrast to our predictions, early and late successional species responded similarly to different silvicultural practices. However, there were indications of marginal assemblage differences both between thinned stands and selective felling and between thinned and old growth stands (p = 0.10). The stand volume of early decay stage wood influenced assemblage composition of early, but not late successional species. Uneven-aged silviculture maintained species assemblages similar to those of the reference and old growth stands and might therefore be a better management option when considering biodiversity conservation.

AB In the environment bacteria share their habitat with a great diversity of organisms, from microbes to humans, animals and plants. In these complex communities, the production of extracellular effectors is a common strategy to control the biodiversity by interfering with the growth and/or viability of nearby microbes. One of such effectors relies on the production and release of extracellular D-amino acids which regulate diverse cellular processes such as cell wall biogenesis, biofilm integrity, and spore germination. Non-canonical D-amino acids are mainly produced by broad spectrum racemases (Bsr). Bsr's promiscuity allows it to generate high concentrations of D-amino acids in environments with variable compositions of L-amino acids. However, it was not clear until recent whether these molecules exhibit divergent functions. Here we review the distinctive biological roles of D-amino acids, their mechanisms of action and their modulatory properties of the biodiversity of complex eco-systems.

SO PLOS ONE

DT Article
ID BRIGADE COMBAT TEAM; MILITARY PERSONNEL; PREMATURE DISCHARGE;
   RISK-FACTORS; PAIN; INTERVENTION; THERAPIST
AB Background
   Musculoskeletal complaints and injuries (MSCI) are common in military populations. However, only a limited number of studies have followed soldiers during international deployments and investigated the prevalence of MSCI during and at the end of their deployment. The aim was to describe the prevalence of MSCI in different military occupational specialties and categorise their most common tasks in terms of exposures to physical workloads during a six-month long international deployment in Afghanistan.
   Methods
   Cross-sectional survey, including 325 soldiers (300 men), aged 20-62 participating in an international deployment in Afghanistan during the spring of 2012. Soldiers were clustered into different military occupational specialties: Infantry, Administration, Logistics, Logistics/Camp, Medical and Other. Data were collected through the use of the Musculoskeletal Screening Protocol at the end of the international mission.
   Results
   Forty-seven percent reported MSCI during deployment, with 28% at the end.
   The most common locations of MSCI during the mission were lower back, knee, shoulders, upper back, neck and foot, while the knee and lower back prevailed at the end of the mission. Almost half of the soldiers who had MSCI reported affected work ability. The most common duties during the mission were vehicle patrolling, staff duties, guard/security duties, foot patrols and transportation. Soldiers reported that vehicle patrolling, staff duties and transportation were demanding with respect to endurance strength, guard/security duties challenged both maximum and endurance strength while foot patrolling challenged maximum and endurance strength, aerobic and anaerobic endurance and speed.
   Conclusions
   MSCI during international deployment are common among Swedish soldiers. The results indicate the need to further develop strategies focusing on matching the soldiers' capacity to the job requirements, with relevant and fair physical selection-tests during the recruitment process and proactive interventions targeting MSCI before and during deployment, in order to enhance soldiers' readiness and promote operational readiness.

AB Background
   Data are lacking on the risk and impact of a serious hemorrhage on the prognosis after ischemic stroke (IS) or transient ischemic attack (TIA). We aimed to estimate the incidence of serious hemorrhage, analyze the impact on mortality, and identify predictors of hemorrhage after discharge from IS or TIA.
   Methods and findings
   All patients admitted to Ostersund Hospital for an IS or TIA in 2010-2013 were included (n = 1528, mean age: 75.1 years). Serious hemorrhages were identified until 31st December 2015. Incidence rates were calculated. The impact on mortality (stratified by functional level) was determined with Kaplan-Meier analysis. Non-parametric estimation under the assumption of competing risk was performed to assess the cumulative incidence and predictors of serious hemorrhages.
   The incidence rates of serious (n = 113) and intracranial hemorrhages (n = 45) after discharge from IS and TIA were 2.48% and 0.96% per year at risk, respectively. Patients with modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores of 3-5 exhibited 58.9% mortality during follow-up and those with mRS scores of 0-2 exhibited 18.4% mortality. A serious hemorrhage did not affect mortality in patients with impaired functional status, but it increased the risk of death in patients with mRS scores of 0-2. Hypertension was associated with increased risk of serious hemorrhage.
   Conclusions
   We found that, after discharge from an IS or TIA, serious hemorrhages were fairly common. Impairments in function were associated with high mortality, but serious hemorrhages only increased the risk of mortality in patients with no or slight disability. Improved hypertension treatment may decrease the risk of serious hemorrhage, but in patients with low functional status, poor survival makes secondary prevention challenging.

AB Background: Several large scale community-based cardiovascular disease prevention programs were initiated in the 80s, and one was the Vasterbotten Intervention Programme, Sweden. As an initial step in 1985, a pilot study was introduced in the Norsjo municipality that combined individual disease prevention efforts among the middle-aged population with community-oriented health promotion activities. All citizens at 30, 40, 50, and 60 years of age were invited to a physical examination combined with a healthy dialogue at the local primary health care centre. Vasterbotten Intervention Program is still running following the same lines and is now a part of the ordinary public health in the county. The purpose of this study is to estimate the costs of running Vasterbotten Intervention Programme from 1990 to 2006, versus the health gains and savings reasonably attributable to the program during the same time period.
   Methods: A previous study estimated the number of prevented deaths during the period 1990-2006 which can be attributed to the programme. We used this estimate and calculated the number of QALYs gained, as well as savings in resources due to prevented non-fatal cases during the time period 1990 to 2006. Costs for the programmes were based on previously published scientific articles as well as current cost data from the county council, who is responsible for the programme.
   Result: The cost per QALY gained from a societal perspective is SEK 650 (Euro 68). From a health care sector perspective, the savings attributable to the VIP exceeded its costs.
   Conclusion: Our analysis shows that Vasterbotten Intervention Programme is extremely cost-effective in relation to the Swedish threshold value (SEK 500000 per QALY gained or Euro 53,000 per QALY gained). Other research has also shown a favorable effect of Vasterbotten Intervention Programme on population health and the health gap. We therefore argue that all health care organizations, acting in settings reasonably similar to Sweden, have good incentive to implement programs like Vasterbotten Intervention Programme.

AB Relapsing fever still remains a neglected disease and little is known on its reservoir, tick vector and physiopathology in the vertebrate host. The disease occurs in temperate as well as tropical countries. Relapsing fever borreliae are spirochaetes, members of the Borreliaceae family which also contain Lyme disease spirochaetes. They are mainly transmitted by Ornithodoros soft ticks, but some species are vectored by ixodid ticks. Traditionally a Borrelia species is associated with a specific vector in a particular geographical area. However, new species are regularly described, and taxonomical uncertainties deserve further investigations to better understand Borrelia vector/host adaptation. The medical importance of Borrelia miyamotoi, transmitted by Ixodes spp., has recently spawned new interest in this bacterial group. In this review, recent data on tick-host-pathogen interactions for tick-borne relapsing fevers is presented, with special focus on B. miyamotoi.

AB A homologous family of low-coordinate complexes of the formulation trans-[M(2,2'-biphenyl)(PR3)(2)][BAr4F] (M = Rh, Ir; R = Ph, Cy, iPr, iBu) has been prepared and extensively structurally characterised. Enabled through a comprehensive set of solution phase (VT H-1 and (PNMR)-P-31 spectroscopy) and solid-state (single crystal X-ray diffraction) data, and analysis in silico (DFT-based NBO and QTAIM analysis), the structural features of the constituent agostic interactions have been systematically interrogated. The combined data substantiates the adoption of stronger agostic interactions for the Ir-III compared to Rh-III complexes and, with respect to the phosphine ligands, in the order PiBu(3) > PCy3 > PiPr(3) > PPh3. In addition to these structure-property relationships, the effect of crystal packing on the agostic interactions was investigated in the tricyclohexylphosphine complexes. Compression of the associated cations, through inclusion of a more bulky solvent molecule (1,2-difluorobenzene vs. CH2Cl2) in the lattice or collection of data at very low temperature (25 vs. 150K), lead to small but statistically significant shortening of the (M) under bar -H-(C) under bar distances.

AB Background: Over the last decades, many forest simulators have been developed for the forests of individual European countries. The underlying growth models are usually based on national datasets of varying size, obtained from National Forest Inventories or from long-term research plots. Many of these models include country- and location-specific predictors, such as site quality indices that may aggregate climate, soil properties and topography effects. Consequently, it is not sensible to compare such models among countries, and it is often impossible to apply models outside the region or country they were developed for. However, there is a clear need for more generically applicable but still locally accurate and climate sensitive simulators at the European scale, which requires the development of models that are applicable across the European continent. The purpose of this study is to develop tree diameter increment models that are applicable at the European scale, but still locally accurate. We compiled and used a dataset of diameter increment observations of over 2.3 million trees from 10 National Forest Inventories in Europe and a set of 99 potential explanatory variables covering forest structure, weather, climate, soil and nutrient deposition.
   Results: Diameter increment models are presented for 20 species/species groups. Selection of explanatory variables was done using a combination of forward and backward selection methods. The explained variance ranged from 10% to 53% depending on the species. Variables related to forest structure (basal area of the stand and relative size of the tree) contributed most to the explained variance, but environmental variables were important to account for spatial patterns. The type of environmental variables included differed greatly among species.
   Conclusions: The presented diameter increment models are the first of their kind that are applicable at the European scale. This is an important step towards the development of a new generation of forest development simulators that can be applied at the European scale, but that are sensitive to variations in growing conditions and applicable to a wider range of management systems than before. This allows European scale but detailed analyses concerning topics like CO2 sequestration, wood mobilisation, long term impact of management, etc.

AB Ecophysiological characterizations of photoautotrophic communities are not only necessary to identify the response of carbon fixation related to different climatic factors, but also to evaluate risks connected to changing environments. In biological soil crusts (BSCs), the description of ecophysiological features is difficult, due to the high variability in taxonomic composition and variable methodologies applied. Especially for BSCs in early successional stages, the available datasets are rare or focused on individual constituents, although these crusts may represent the only photoautotrophic component in many heavily disturbed ruderal areas, such as parking lots or building areas with increasing surface area worldwide. We analyzed the response of photosynthesis and respiration to changing BSC water contents (WCs), temperature and light in two early successional BSCs. We investigated whether the response of these parameters was different between intact BSC and the isolated dominating components. BSCs dominated by the cyanobacterium Nostoc commune and dominated by the green alga Zygogonium ericetorum were examined. A major divergence between the two BSCs was their absolute carbon fixation rate on a chlorophyll basis, which was significantly higher for the cyanobacterial crust. Nevertheless, independent of species composition, both crust types and their isolated organisms had convergent features such as high light acclimatization and a minor and very late-occurring depression in carbon uptake at water suprasaturation. This particular setup of ecophysiological features may enable these communities to cope with a high variety of climatic stresses and may therefore be a reason for their success in heavily disturbed areas with ongoing human impact. However, the shape of the response was different for intact BSC compared to separated organ-isms, especially in absolute net photosynthesis (NP) rates. This emphasizes the importance of measuring intact BSCs under natural conditions for collecting reliable data for meaningful analysis of BSC ecosystem services.

AB Muscle atrophy is one of the main characteristics of human ageing and physical inactivity, with resulting adverse health outcomes. To date, there are still no efficient therapeutic strategies for its prevention and/or treatment. However, during hibernation, bears exhibit a unique ability for preserving muscle in conditions where muscle atrophy would be expected in humans. Therefore, our objective was to determine whether there are components of bear serum which can control protein balance in human muscles. In this study, we exposed cultured human differentiated muscle cells to bear serum collected during winter and summer periods, and measured the impact on cell protein content and turnover. In addition, we explored the signalling pathways that control rates of protein synthesis and degradation. We show that the protein turnover of human myotubes is reduced when incubated with winter bear serum, with a dramatic inhibition of proteolysis involving both proteasomal and lysosomal systems, and resulting in an increase in muscle cell protein content. By modulating intracellular signalling pathways and inducing a protein sparing phenotype in human muscle cells, winter bear serum therefore holds potential for developing new tools to fight human muscle atrophy and related metabolic disorders.

AB Background: Understanding what influences people to seek help can inform interventions to promote earlier diagnosis of cancer, and ultimately better cancer survival. We aimed to examine relationships between negative cancer beliefs, recognition of cancer symptoms and how long people think they would take to go to the doctor with possible cancer symptoms (anticipated patient intervals).
   Methods: Telephone interviews of 20,814 individuals (50+) in the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, Denmark, Norway and Sweden were carried out using the Awareness and Beliefs about Cancer Measure (ABC). ABC included items on cancer beliefs, recognition of cancer symptoms and anticipated time to help-seeking for cough and rectal bleeding. The anticipated time to help-seeking was dichotomised as over one month for persistent cough and over one week for rectal bleeding.
   Results: Not recognising persistent cough/hoarseness and unexplained bleeding as cancer symptoms increased the likelihood of a longer anticipated patient interval for persistent cough (OR = 1.66; 95% CI = 1.47-1.87) and rectal bleeding (OR = 1.90; 95% CI = 1.58-2.30), respectively. Endorsing four or more out of six negative beliefs about cancer increased the likelihood of longer anticipated patient intervals for persistent cough and rectal bleeding (OR = 2.18; 95% CI = 1.71-2.78 and OR = 1.97; 95% CI = 1.51-2.57). Many negative beliefs about cancer moderated the relationship between not recognising unexplained bleeding as a cancer symptom and longer anticipated patient interval for rectal bleeding (p = 0.005).
   Conclusions: Intervention studies should address both negative beliefs about cancer and knowledge of symptoms to optimise the effect.

AB Background: Implementation of interventions concerning prevention and health promotion in health care has faced particular challenges resulting in a low frequency and quality of these services. In November 2011, the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare released national clinical practice guidelines to counteract patients' unhealthy lifestyle habits. Drawing on the results of a previous study as a point of departure, the aim of this two-year follow up was to assess the progress of work with lifestyle interventions in primary healthcare as well as the uptake and usage of the new guidelines on lifestyle interventions in clinical practice.
   Methods: Longitudinal study among health professionals with survey at baseline and 2 years later. Development over time and differences between professional groups were calculated with Pearson chi-square test.
   Results: Eighteen percent of the physicians reported to use the clinical practice guidelines, compared to 58% of the nurses. Nurses were also more likely to consider them as a support in their work than physicians did. Over time, health professionals usage of methods to change patients' tobacco habits and hazardous use of alcohol had increased, and the nurses worked to a higher extent than before with all four lifestyles. Knowledge on methods for lifestyle change was generally high; however, there was room for improvement concerning methods on alcohol, unhealthy eating and counselling. Forty-one percent reported to possess thorough knowledge of counselling skills.
   Conclusions: Even if the uptake and usage of the CPGs on lifestyle interventions so far is low, the participants reported more frequent counselling on patients' lifestyle changes concerning use of tobacco and hazardous use of alcohol. However, these findings should be evaluated acknowledging the possibility of selection bias in favour of health promotion and lifestyle guidance, and the loss of one study site in the follow up. Furthermore, this study indicates important differences in physicians and nurses' attitudes to and use of the guidelines, where the nurses reported working to a higher extent with all four lifestyles compared to the first study. These findings suggest further investigations on the implementation process in clinical practice, and the physicians' uptake and use of the CPGs.

DT Article
ID OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY-DISEASE; HEALTH SURVEY; POPULATION; ADULTS;
   PREVALENCE; INSOMNIA
AB Background
   The term Asthma and COPD Overlap (ACO) describes a condition where asthma and COPD overlap. We aimed to investigate associations between ACO and insomnia and respiratory symptoms, and to investigate the prevalence of ACO and the characteristics of subjects with ACO in two Northern European population studies.
   Methods
   The study comprised 25 429 subjects aged >40 years who participated in one of two Northern European general population surveys. Both surveys included questions on asthma, COPD, respiratory and sleep-related symptoms, including difficulty initiating sleep, difficulty maintaining sleep, early-morning awakening, and excessive daytime sleepiness. ACO was defined as having both self-reported asthma and COPD.
   Results
   The prevalence of ACO was 1.0%. The group with ACO had a higher prevalence of both insomnia and respiratory symptoms than subjects with only asthma or COPD. Having ACO was independently associated with a 2-3 times higher probability of having sleep-related symptoms as compared with the group without asthma or COPD, after adjustment for age, sex, BMI, smoking history and educational level (adjusted odds ratio 2.14-3.36, 95% CI).
   Conclusion
   Subjects with ACO have a high prevalence of insomnia and respiratory symptoms. To our knowledge, this is the first study to assess the association between sleep-related symptoms and ACO.

TI Executive function associated with sexual risk in young South African
   women: Findings from the HPTN 068 cohort
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID OF-THE-LITERATURE; DECISION-MAKING; WORKING-MEMORY; COGNITIVE
   PERFORMANCE; PHYSICAL-EDUCATION; TRANSACTIONAL SEX; ADOLESCENT BRAIN;
   HIV; HEALTH; PREVALENCE
AB Purpose
   Heightened sexual risk in adolescence and young adulthood may be partially explained by deficits in executive functioning, the set of cognitive processes used to make reasoned decisions. However, the association between executive function and sexual risk is understudied among adolescent girls and young women, particularly in low- and middle-income countries.
   Methods
   In a cohort of 853 young women age 18-25 in rural Mpumalanga province, South Africa, we evaluated executive function with three non-verbal cognitive tests: I. a rule-finding test, II. a trail-making test, and III. a figure drawing test. Using log-binomial regression models, we estimated the association between lower executive function test scores and indicators of sexual risk (unprotected sex acts, concurrent partnerships, transactional sex, and recent HSV-2 infection).
   Results
   In general, young women with lower executive function scores reported higher frequencies of sexual risk outcomes, though associations tended to be small with wide confidence intervals. Testing in the lowest quintile of Test I was associated with more unprotected sex [aPR (95% CI): 1.4 (1.0, 1.8)]. Testing in the lowest quintile of Test II was associated with more concurrent relationships and transactional sex [aPR (95% CI): 1.6 (1.1, 2.5) and 1.7 (1.3, 2.4), respectively], and testing in the lowest four quintiles of Test III was associated with more concurrent relationships [aPR (95% CI): 1.7 (1.0, 2.7)].
   Conclusions
   These results demonstrate an association between low executive function and sexual risk in South African young women. Future work should seek to understand the nature of this association and whether there is promise in developing interventions to enhance executive function to reduce sexual risk.

AB Brassinosteroid (BR) hormone signaling controls multiple processes during plant growth and development and is initiated at the plasma membrane through the receptor kinase BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE1 (BRI1) together with co-receptors such as BRI1-ASSOCIATED RECEPTOR KINASE1 (BAK1). BRI1 abundance is regulated by endosomal recycling and vacuolar targeting, but the role of vacuole-related proteins in BR receptor dynamics and BR responses remains elusive. Here, we show that the absence of two DUF300 domain-containing tonoplast proteins, LAZARUS1 (LAZ1) and LAZ1 HOMOLOG1 (LAZ1H1), causes vacuole morphology defects, growth inhibition, and constitutive activation of BR signaling. Intriguingly, tonoplast accumulation of BAK1 was substantially increased and appeared causally linked to enhanced BRI1 trafficking and degradation in laz1 laz1h1 plants. Since unrelated vacuole mutants exhibited normal BR responses, our findings indicate that DUF300 proteins play distinct roles in the regulation of BR signaling by maintaining vacuole integrity required to balance subcellular BAK1 pools and BR receptor distribution.

AB Atlantic salmon Salmo salar smolts were produced with similar energetic states as wild S. salar and the effect of low energetic state on smolt migration was tested. The total energetic state of the fish (body lipids and proteins) in the spring was correlated with Fulton's condition factor (K). Fish at a low energetic state swam slower but migrated further than fish at a higher energetic state when tested in two experimental streams. During a period of starvation throughout the winter and spring, fish conserved their body-lipid reserves at 1<bold></bold>5% by using more protein as an energy source and the metabolic shift occurred between 3<bold></bold>5 and 1<bold></bold>5% body lipids. An energetic state of approximately 3<bold></bold>5kJ g(-1) (K approximate to 0<bold></bold>65) appeared to be the critical limit for survival.

AB Despite higher educational investments, women fall behind men on most indicators of labour market success. This study investigates whether workplace skill investments set men and women off on different tracks in which the human capital acquired through higher education is either devalued or further developed. A survey sample of Swedish men and women who recently graduated from five educational programmes, leading to occupations with different gender composition, is analysed (N approximate to 2300). Results show that, a few years after graduation, men are more likely than women to acquire complex jobs and that this difference contributes to early career gender gaps in wages and employee bargaining power. The findings do not support the notion that child-related work interruptions provide a main mechanism for sorting women into less complex jobs.

AB Recently, the biased and highly selective 5-HT1A agonists, NLX-112, F13714 and F15599, have been shown to alleviate dyskinesia in rodent and primate models of Parkinson's disease, while marginally interfering with antiparkinsonian effects of levodopa. To provide more detailed information on the processes underlying the alleviation of dyskinesia, we have here investigated changes in the spectral contents of local field potentials in cortico-basal ganglia-thalamic circuits following treatment with this novel group of 5-HT1A agonists or the prototypical agonist, 8-OH-DPAT. Dyskinetic symptoms were consistently associated with 80 Hz oscillations, which were efficaciously suppressed by all 5-HT1A agonists and reappeared upon co-administration of the antagonist, WAY100635. At the same time, the peak-frequency of fast 130 Hz gamma oscillations and their cross-frequency coupling to low-frequency delta oscillations were modified to a different extent by each of the 5-HT1A agonists. These findings suggest that the common antidyskinetic effects of these drugs may be chiefly attributable to a reversal of the brain state characterized by 80 Hz gamma oscillations, whereas the differential effects on fast gamma oscillations may reflect differences in pharmacological properties that might be of potential relevance for non-motor symptoms.

AB Aims
   The aims of this study were to investigate any possible relationship between a preoperative sensitivity to pain and the degree of pain at rest and on exertion with postoperative function in patients who underwent stemless total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA).
   Patients and Methods
   In this prospective study, we included 63 patients who underwent stemless TSA and were available for evaluation one year postoperatively. There were 31 women and 32 men; their mean age was 71 years (53 to 89). The pain threshold, which was measured using a Pain Matcher (PM) unit, the degree of pain (visual analogue scale at rest and on exertion, and function using the short version of the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand questionnaire (QuickDASH), were recorded preoperatively, as well as three and 12 months postoperatively.
   Results
   We found an inverse relationship between both the preoperative PM threshold and pain (VAS) at rest and the 12-month postoperative QuickDASH score (Pearson correlation coefficient (r) >= 0.4, p < 0.05). A linear regression analysis showed that the preoperative PM threshold on the affected side and preoperative pain (VAS) at rest were the only factors associated with the QuickDASH score at 12 months.
   Conclusion
   These findings indicate the importance of central sensitization in the restoration of function after TSA. Further studies are required to investigate whether extra analgesia and rehabilitation could influence the outcome in at risk patients.

AB Macrodomains recognize intracellular adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-ribosylation resulting in either removal of the modification or a protein interaction event. Research into compounds that modulate macrodomain functions could make important contributions. We investigated the interactions of all seven individual macrodomains of the human poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) family members PARP9, PARP14, and PARP15 with five mono-ADP-ribosylated (automodified) ADP-ribosyltransferase domains using an AlphaScreen assay. Several mono-ADP-ribosylation-dependent interactions were identified, and they were found to be in the micromolar affinity range using surface plasmon resonance (SPR). We then focused on the interaction between PARP14 macrodomain-2 and the mono-ADP-ribosylated PARP10 catalytic domain, and probed a similar to 1500-compound diverse library for inhibitors of this interaction using AlphaScreen. Initial hit compounds were verified by concentration-response experiments using AlphaScreen and SPR, and they were tested against PARP14 macrodomain-2 and -3. Two initial hit compounds and one chemical analog each were further characterized using SPR and microscale thermophoresis. In conclusion, our results reveal novel macrodomain interactions and establish protocols for identification of inhibitors of such interactions.

AB Chronic inflammation plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of the 2 major types of gastric cancer. Several foods, nutrients, and nonnutrient food components seem to be involved in the regulation of chronic inflammation.
   We assessed the association between the inflammatory potential of the diet and the risk of gastric carcinoma, overall and for the 2 major subsites: cardia cancers and noncardia cancers.
   A total of 476,160 subjects (30% men, 70% women) from the European Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) study were followed for 14 y, during which 913 incident cases of gastric carcinoma were identified, including 236 located in the cardia, 341 in the distal part of the stomach (noncardia), and 336 with overlapping or unknown tumor site. The dietary inflammatory potential was assessed by means of an inflammatory score of the diet (ISD), calculated with the use of 28 dietary components and their corresponding inflammatory scores. The association between the ISD and gastric cancer risk was estimated by HRs and 95% CIs calculated by multivariate Cox regression models adjusted for confounders.
   The inflammatory potential of the diet was associated with an increased risk of gastric cancer. The HR (95% CI) for each increase in 1 SD of the ISD were 1.25 (1.12, 1.39) for all gastric cancers, 1.30 (1.06, 1.59) for cardia cancers, and 1.07 (0.89, 1.28) for noncardia cancers. The corresponding values for the highest compared with the lowest quartiles of the ISD were 1.66 (1.26, 2.20), 1.94 (1.14, 3.30), and 1.07 (0.70, 1.70), respectively.
   Our results suggest that low-grade chronic inflammation induced by the diet may be associated with gastric cancer risk. This pattern seems to be more consistent for gastric carcinomas located in the cardia than for those located in the distal stomach.
   This study is listed on the ISRCTN registry as ISRCTN12136108.

AB Objectives To describe the incidence of atrioventricular (AV) block II-III, atrial fibrillation (AF), pacemaker implantation (PM) and aortic regurgitation in patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS), undifferentiated spondyloarthritis (uSpA) and psoriatic arthritis (PsA) compared with the general population (GP) and with each other.
   Methods A prospective nationwide study with cohorts of patients with AS (n=6448), PsA (n=16063) and uSpA (n=5190) and a GP (n=266435) cohort, identified in 2001-2009 in the Swedish National Patient and Population registers. Follow-up began on 1 January 2006 and ended at event, death, emigration or 31 December 2012. Age-standardised and sex-standardised incidence rates and hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated.
   Results The highest incidence rates were noted for AF (5.5-7.4 events per 1000 person-years), followed by PM (1.0-2.0 events per 1000 person-years). HRs for AV block, AF, PM and aortic regurgitation were significantly increased in AS (HRs 2.3, 1.3, 2.1 and 1.9), uSpA (HRs 2.9, 1.3, 1.9 and 2.0) and PsA (HRs 1.5, 1.5, 1.6 and 1.8) compared with the GP cohort. The highest HRs were seen for AV block in male uSpA (HR 4.2) and AS (HR 2.5) compared with GP. Compared with PsA, significantly increased HRs were noted for PM (HR 1.5) in AS and for AV block (HR 1.8) in uSpA.
   Conclusions Patients with SpA are at increased risk of aortic regurgitation, cardiac rhythm disturbances and, as a probable consequence, also PM. Particularly for AF, the most common arrhythmia, increased caution is warranted, whereas AV block should be looked for especially in men with AS or uSpA.

AB Contrasting carbon: nitrogen: phosphorus (C: N: P) stoichiometry between phytoplankton and zooplankton affect consumer growth and phytoplankton nutrient limitation via nutrient recycling by zooplankton. However, no study has assessed how regional differences in terrestrial loadings of organic matter affect plankton N: P stoichiometry and recycling in systems with low N deposition and N-limited phytoplankton. We address this question by using data from 14 unproductive headwater arctic and boreal lakes. We found that boreal lakes had higher lake water-and seston C, N and P concentrations than arctic lakes, whereas seston C: N, C: P and N: P ratios did not differ among regions. Boreal zooplankton were also richer in N and P relative to C, with lower somatic N: P ratios, compared to arctic lakes. Consequently, the estimated N: P imbalances between seston and zooplankton were negative in arctic lakes, indicating zooplankton feeding on phytoplankton of suboptimal N content, resulting in low consumer driven N: P recycling (medians arctic sub-mid and high altitude lakes: 11 and 13). In boreal lakes, estimated N: P imbalance did not differ from zero, with a seston N: P stoichiometry matching the N: P requirements of zooplankton, which resulted in higher consumer driven N: P recycling (median 18). Our results imply that regional climate induced catchment differences, through enhanced terrestrial nutrient inputs, affect plankton stoichiometry by raising consumer N: P recycling ratio and changing zooplankton from being mainly N-(arctic) to NP co-limited (boreal). Browning of lakes, in regions with low N deposition, may therefore promote large-scale regional changes in plankton nutrient limitation with potential feedbacks on pelagic food webs.

AB Aims To explore the role of corneal-shaped static mechanical strain on the differentiation of human periodontal ligament stem cells (PDLSCs) into keratocytes and the possible synergistic effects of mechanics and inducing medium.
   Methods PDLSCs were exposed to 3% static dome-shaped mechanical strain in a Flexcell Tension System for 3 days and 7 days. Keratocyte phenotype was determined by gene expression of keratocyte markers. Keratocyte differentiation (inducing) medium was introduced in the Flexcell system, either continuously or intermittently combined with mechanical stimulation. The synergistic effects of mechanics and inducing medium on keratocyte differentiation was evaluated by gene and protein expression of keratocyte markers. Finally, a multilamellar cell sheet was assembled by seeding PDLSCs on a collagen membrane and inducing keratocyte differentiation. The transparency of the cell sheet was assessed, and typical markers of native human corneal stroma were evaluated by immunofluorescence staining.
   Results Dome-shaped mechanical stimulation promoted PDLSCs to differentiate into keratocytes, as shown by the upregulation of ALDH3A1, CD34, LUM, COL I and COL V. The expression of integrins were also upregulated after mechanical stimulation, including integrin alpha 1, alpha 2, beta 1 and non-muscle myosin II B. A synergistic effect of mechanics and inducing medium was found on keratocyte differentiation. The cell sheets were assembled under the treatment of mechanics and inducing medium simultaneously. The cell sheets were transparent, multilamellar and expressed typical markers of corneal stroma.
   Conclusion Dome-shaped mechanical stimulation promotes differentiation of PDLSCs into keratocytes and has synergistic effects with inducing medium. Multilamellar cell sheets that resemble native human corneal stroma show potential for future clinical applications.

AB Trafficking of mammalian ATG9A between the Golgi apparatus, endosomes and peripheral ATG9A compartments is important for autophagosome biogenesis. Here, we show that the membrane remodelling protein SNX18, previously identified as a positive regulator of autophagy, regulates ATG9A trafficking from recycling endosomes. ATG9A is recruited to SNX18-induced tubules generated from recycling endosomes and accumulates in juxtanuclear recycling endosomes in cells lacking SNX18. Binding of SNX18 to Dynamin-2 is important for ATG9A trafficking from recycling endosomes and for formation of ATG16L1- and WIPI2-positive autophagosome precursor membranes. We propose a model where upon autophagy induction, SNX18 recruits Dynamin-2 to induce budding of ATG9A and ATG16L1 containing membranes from recycling endosomes that traffic to sites of autophagosome formation.

AB Wetlands are common net producers of the neurotoxin monomethylmercury (MeHg) and are largely responsible for MeHg bioaccumulation in aquatic food-webs. However, not all wetlands net produce MeHg; notable exceptions are black alder (Alnus glutinosa) swamps, which net degrade MeHg. Here we report the mechanisms of MeHg demethylation in one such swamp (EHT), shown to be a sink for MeHg during four consecutive years. The potential demethylation rate constant (k(d) ) in soil incubations was similar to 3 times higher in the downstream (EHT-D: k(d) similar to 0.14 d(-1)) as compared to the upstream part of the swamp (EHT-U: k(d) 0.05 d(-1)). This difference concurred with increased stream and soil pH, and a change in plant community composition. Electron acceptor and inhibitor addition experiments revealed that abiotic demethylation dominated at EHT-U while an additional and equally large contribution from biotic degradation was observed at EHT-D, explaining the increase in MeHg degradation. Biotic demethylation (EHT-D) was primarily due to methanogens, inferred by a decrease in k(d) to autoclaved levels following selective inhibition of methanogens. Though methanogen-specific transcripts (mcrA) were found throughout the wetland, transcripts clustering with Methanosaetaceae were exclusive to EHT-D, suggesting a possible role for these acetoclastic methanogens in the degradation of MeHg.

AB Project management (PM) is one of many occupations following a path to professionalization that includes voluntary certification. It has been said that certification, and especially voluntary certification, can be seen as an approach to being good by improving our competence in the profession, or a means to looking good, essentially signaling the capabilities of the holder. Based on self-determination theory, we contribute to this discussion the notion of feeling good whereby certification provides a way to challenge one's capabilities, provide self-actualization, and a sense of worth. Using two sets of survey responses, collected 10 years apart (2004 and 2014), we assess whether there are differences in the demographics of those seeking voluntary project management certification, and the motivations (expected benefits), and realized benefits associated with this certification, at these two points in time. Demographically, the people with certification and those not pursuing certification did not exhibit any significant differences in either time period. Analyses indicate that feeling good and being good are the main motivators but participants pursuing certification in 2014 reported lower levels of motivations and received more benefit than those in 2004. Comparing responses as to why professionals pursue voluntary PM certification across a decade span, gives us an indication of how these perceptions may be changing with the increased popularity of the certification. We compare these findings to similar studies examining other volunteer certifications and conclude by discussing the potential impact of these changes from the perspective of the individuals seeking certification, the occupation, and certifying organizations.

AB Fish oil (FO) alters ruminal biohydrogenation causing trans fatty acid (FA) intermediates to accumulate, but the effects of 18-carbon polyunsaturated FA supply on ruminal long-chain FA metabolism and microbial communities in cattle fed FO are not well established. Four cows fitted with rumen cannula were used in a 4 x 4 Latin square with 21-d experimental periods to evaluate the effects of FO alone or in combination with plant oils high in 18:2n-6 or 18: 3n-3 on rumen microbial ecology and flow of FA at the omasum. Treatments comprised a basal grass silage-based diet containing no additional oil (control) or supplements of FO (200 g/d) or FO (200 g/d) plus 500 g/d of sunflower oil (SFO) or linseed oil (LFO). Flow of FA was determined using the omasal sampling technique. The relative abundance of key biohydrogenating bacteria was assessed by quantitative PCR on 16S rRNA genes in omasal digesta. Fish oil-supplemented treatments increased the amounts of trans-18:1, trans-18:2, and 20- to 22-carbon polyunsaturated FA escaping the rumen. Relative to the control, oil supplements had no effect on the amount of 18: 0 leaving the rumen, but LFO decreased the flow of 18:0 at the omasum compared with SFO. Both SFO and LFO increased trans-18:1 relative to FO, whereas LFO resulted in the highest trans-18:2 and 20- to 22-carbon FA flow. Supplements of FO plus plant oils shifted biohydrogenation toward trans-10 18:1 formation. Compared with FO alone, the ruminal metabolism of 22:6n-3 in the rumen of lactating cows is more extensive on diets containing higher amounts of 18-carbon polyunsaturated FA. However, the biohydrogenation of 22: 5n-3 was less extensive in LFO than SFO, but showed no difference between FO and diets containing plant oils. Ruminal outflow of 20: 5n-3 was not altered when plant oils were added to FO. Alterations in the amount of intermediates at the omasum or ruminal biohydrogenation pathways were not accompanied by major changes in analyzed bacterial populations. In conclusion, dietary supplements of FO alone or in combination with plant oils increase the amount of biohydrogenation intermediates containing 1 or more trans double bonds escaping the rumen, which may have implications for host metabolism and the nutritional quality of ruminant foods.

AB 1. Long-term climate change experiments are extremely valuable for studying ecosystem responses to environmental change. Examination of the vegetation and the soil should be non-destructive to guarantee long-term research. In this paper, we review field methods using isotope techniques for assessing carbon dynamics in the plant-soil-air continuum, based on recent field experience and examples from a European climate change manipulation network.
   2. Eight European semi-natural shrubland ecosystems were exposed to warming and drought manipulations. One field site was additionally exposed to elevated atmospheric CO2. We discuss the isotope methods that were used across the network to evaluate carbon fluxes and ecosystem responses, including: (1) analysis of the naturally rare isotopes of carbon (C-13 and C-14) and nitrogen (N-15); (2) use of in situ pulse labelling with (CO2)-C-13, soil injections of C-13- and N-15-enriched substrates, or continuous labelling by free air carbon dioxide enrichment (FACE) and (3) manipulation of isotopic composition of soil substrates (C-14) in laboratory-based studies.
   3. The natural C-14 signature of soil respiration gave insight into a possible long-term shift in the partitioning between the decomposition of young and old soil carbon sources. Contrastingly, the stable isotopes C-13 and N-15 were used for shorter-term processes, as the residence time in a certain compartment of the stable isotope label signal is limited. The use of labelled carbon-compounds to study carbon mineralisation by soil micro-organisms enabled to determine the long-term effect of climate change on microbial carbon uptake kinetics and turnover.
   4. Based on the experience with the experimental work, we provide recommendations for the application of the reviewed methods to study carbon fluxes in the plant-soil-air continuum in climate change experiments. C-13-labelling techniques exert minimal physical disturbances, however, the dilution of the applied isotopic signal can be challenging. In addition, the contamination of the field site with excess C-13 or C-14 can be a problem for subsequent natural abundance (C-14 and C-13) or label studies. The use of slight changes in carbon and nitrogen natural abundance does not present problems related to potential dilution or contamination risks, but the usefulness depends on the fractionation rate of the studied processes.

AB We aggregated coding variant data for 81,412 type 2 diabetes cases and 370,832 controls of diverse ancestry, identifying 40 coding variant association signals (P < 2.2 x 10(-7)); of these, 16 map outside known risk-associated loci. We make two important observations. First, only five of these signals are driven by low-frequency variants: even for these, effect sizes are modest (odds ratio <= 1.29). Second, when we used large-scale genome-wide association data to fine-map the associated variants in their regional context, accounting for the global enrichment of complex trait associations in coding sequence, compelling evidence for coding variant causality was obtained for only 16 signals. At 13 others, the associated coding variants clearly represent 'false leads' with potential to generate erroneous mechanistic inference. Coding variant associations offer a direct route to biological insight for complex diseases and identification of validated therapeutic targets; however, appropriate mechanistic inference requires careful specification of their causal contribution to disease predisposition.

AB This study explores the magnitude and composition of kinship ties at Swedish workplaces. By analysing official register data and illustrating findings from interviews with HR personnel at different workplaces, the following questions are discussed: How much kinship concentration is there today on the labour market in a modern Western society such as Sweden? How is the kin-based selection of workplace members structured by place? The study is based on an analysis of individually connected register information on all workplaces in Sweden in 2012. The number of individual links between relatives and couples at an average workplace amounts to 14% of the number of employees as derived from 310, 000 couples and pairs of relatives among 4.3 million workers. So, even today in Sweden, kinship is a common phenomenon observable for most workers at most workplaces. Of all such connected pairs of kin at workplaces, more than a third contain counterparts living in the same household. A non-linear individual-level regression reveals that population density in the vicinity of the workplace is substantially related to kin density. Large agglomerations seem to coexist with low kin density workplaces. Although some level of kin membership is unavoidable especially at workplaces in sparsely populated places, removing this part still reveals that kinship above an unavoidable level seems to exist. The study contributes to the discussion of kinship in workplaces by examining the magnitude and composition of kinship ties in the whole work force and complementing findings with interviews.

AB This paper presents a density-based topology optimization approach to design compact wideband coaxial-to-waveguide transitions. The underlying optimization problem shows a strong self penalization towards binary solutions, which entails mesh-dependent designs that generally exhibit poor performance. To address the self penalization issue, we develop a filtering approach that consists of two phases. The first phase aims to relax the self penalization by using a sequence of linear filters. The second phase relies on nonlinear filters and aims to obtain binary solutions and to impose minimum-size control on the final design. We present results for optimizing compact transitions between a 50-Ohm coaxial cable and a standard WR90 waveguide operating in the X-band (8-12 GHz).

AB Several coniferous species can today be propagated through somatic embryogenesis, but for species belonging to the Pinus genus, there are still problems related to the small number of genotypes from which embryogenic cultures can be established and the low yield of high-quality cotyledonary embryos. In order to pinpoint molecular processes that might be disturbed during somatic embryogenesis in Scots pine, we have analyzed the expression pattern of selected transcripts during development of somatic embryos in a normal and an abnormal cell line of Scots pine. The selected transcripts have been previously shown to be differentially expressed during early zygotic embryogenesis in Scots pine (Merino et al. 2016). Based on the transcripts that accumulated differentially between the two cell lines, we conclude that the apical-basal polarization in early somatic embryos and the transition from the morphogenic phase to the maturation phase are disturbed in the abnormal cell line. A comparison between transcript accumulation during somatic and zygotic embryogenesis highlighted problems with the continuous embryo degeneration processes in embryogenic cultures of Scots pine. Transcripts that were highly abundant during the cleavage process in zygotic embryos showed different accumulation patterns during somatic embryogenesis in Scots pine compared to those in Norway spruce. Furthermore, altering the expression of these transcripts in embryogenic cultures of Norway spruce resulted in a changed proliferation pattern of the embryos so that they became more similar to proliferating somatic embryos of Scots pine. Taken together, our results provide a deeper understanding of the deviations in abnormal cell lines and indicate that embryogenic cultures of Scots pine are proliferating by a cleavage-like process.

AB IMPORTANCE The role of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) epsilon 4 allele as an effect modifier in lifestyle interventions to prevent cognitive impairment is still unclear.
   OBJECTIVE To examine whether the APOE epsilon 4 allele modifies the previously reported significant cognitive benefits of a multidomain lifestyle intervention (prespecified subgroup analysis).
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The Finnish Geriatric Intervention Study to Prevent Cognitive Impairment and Disability (FINGER) was a randomized clinical trial in 6 centers across Finland (screening and randomization performed from September 7, 2009, through November 24, 2011; intervention duration, 2 years). Data analysis was performed from August 1, 2015, to March 31, 2016. The study population was at-risk older individuals from the general population. Inclusion criteria were age of 60 to 77 years; Cardiovascular Risk Factors, Aging, and Dementia risk score of at least 6 points; and cognition at a mean level or slightly lower than expected for age. Individuals with dementia or substantial cognitive impairment and conditions that prevented cooperation or safe engagement in the intervention were excluded. APOE genotype data were available for 1175 of the 1260 participants.
   INTERVENTIONS Participants were randomly assigned in a 1: 1 ratio to a multidomain intervention group (diet, exercise, cognitive training, and vascular risk management) or a control group (general health advice). Group allocation was not actively disclosed to participants, and outcome assessors were masked to group allocation.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Primary outcome was change in cognition measured through a comprehensive neuropsychological test battery. Analysis was based on modified intention to treat (participants with at least 1 postbaseline assessment).
   RESULTS A total of 1109 participants (mean [SD] age, 69.3 [4.7] years; 514 [46.3%] female) were included in the analysis: 362 APOE epsilon 4 allele carriers (173 intervention and 189 control) and 747 noncarriers (380 intervention and 367 control). The APOE epsilon 4 carriers and noncarriers were not significantly different at baseline (except for serum cholesterol level). The difference between the intervention and control groups in annual neuropsychological test battery total score change was 0.037 (95% CI, 0.001 to 0.073) among carriers and 0.014 (95% CI, -0.011 to 0.039) among noncarriers. Intervention effect was not significantly different between carriers and noncarriers (0.023; 95% CI, -0.021 to 0.067).
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Healthy lifestyle changesmay be beneficial for cognition in older at-risk individuals even in the presence of APOE-related genetic susceptibility to dementia. Whether such benefits are more pronounced in APOE epsilon 4 carriers compared with noncarriers should be further investigated. The findings also emphasize the importance of early prevention strategies that target multiple modifiable risk factors simultaneously.

AB Iron-oxide nanoparticles (NPs) generated by environmental events are likely to represent health problems. alpha-Fe2O3 NPs were synthesized, characterized and tested in a model for toxicity utilizing human whole blood without added anticoagulant. MALDI-TOF of the corona was performed and activation markers for plasma cascade systems (complement, contact and coagulation systems), platelet consumption and release of growth factors, MPO, and chemokine/cytokines from blood cells were analyzed. The coronas formed on the pristine alpha-Fe2O3 NPs contained contact system proteins and they induced massive activation of the contact (kinin/kallikrein) system, as well as thrombin generation, platelet activation, and release of two pro-angiogeneic growth factors: platelet-derived growth factor and vascular endothelial growth factor, whereas complement activation was unaffected. The alpha-Fe2O3 NPs exhibited a noticeable toxicity, with kinin/kallikrein activation, which may be associated with hypotension and long-term angiogenesis in vivo, with implications for cancer, arteriosclerosis and pulmonary disease.

AB We studied the relationship between taking part in a long-distance ski race and incidence of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) to address the hypothesis that lifestyle lowers the incidence.
   A cohort of 399 630 subjects in Sweden, half were skiers in the world's largest ski race, and half were non-skiers. Non-skiers were frequency matched for sex, age, and year of race. Individuals with severe diseases were excluded. The endpoints were death, myocardial infarction, or stroke. The subjects were followed up for a maximum of 21.8 years and median of 9.8 years. We identified 9399 death, myocardial infarction, or stroke events among non-skiers and 4784 among the Vasaloppet skiers. The adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) comparing skiers and non-skiers were 0.52 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.49-0.54] for all-cause mortality, 0.56 (95% CI 0.52-0.60) for myocardial infarction and 0.63 (95% CI 0.58-0.67) for stroke and for all three outcomes 0.56 (95% CI 0.54-0.58). The results were consistent across subgroups: age, sex, family status, education, and race year. For skiers, a doubling of race time was associated with a higher age-adjusted risk of 19%, and male skiers had a doubled risk than female skiers, with a HR 2.06 (95% CI 1.89-2.41). The outcome analyses revealed no differences in risk of atrial fibrillation between skiers and non-skiers.
   This large cohort study provides additional support for the hypothesis that individuals with high level of physical activity representing a healthy lifestyle, as evident by their participation in a long-distance ski race, have a lower risk of CVD or death.

AB 1. Large herbivores can control plant community composition and, under certain conditions, even induce vegetation shifts to alternative ecosystem states. As different plant assemblages maintain contrasting carbon (C) cycling patterns, herbivores have the potential to alter C sequestration at regional scales. Their influence is of particular interest in the Arctic tundra, where a large share of the world's soil C reservoir is stored.
   2. We assessed the influence of grazing mammals on tundra vegetation and C stocks by resampling two sites located along pasture rotation fences in northern Norway. These fences have separated lightly grazed areas from heavily grazed areas (in close proximity to the fences) and moderately grazed areas (further away from the fences) for the past 50years. Fourteen years earlier, the lightly and moderately grazed areas were dominated by dwarf shrubs, whereas heavy grazing had promoted the establishment of graminoid-dominated vegetation. Since then, both reindeer densities and temperatures have increased, and more time has passed for transient dynamics to be expressed. We expected that the vegetation and C stocks would have changed under all grazing intensities, but not necessarily in the same way.
   3. At the site where relative reindeer numbers and trampling intensity had increased the most, graminoid-dominated vegetation was now also found in the moderately grazed area. At the other site, the dominant vegetation types under all grazing intensities were the same as 14 years earlier.
   4. We show that the heavily grazed, graminoid-dominated areas stored less C above-ground than the lightly grazed, shrub-dominated areas. Yet, the below-ground consequences of grazing-induced grassification varied between the sites: Grazing did not alter organic soil C stocks at the site where both evergreen and deciduous shrubs were abundant in the lightly grazed area, whereas heavy grazing increased organic soil C stocks at the site where the deciduous shrub Betula nana was dominant.
   5. Our results indicate that, despite the negative impacts of grazers on above-ground C storage, their impact on below-ground C may even be positive. We suggest that the site-specific responses of organic soil C stocks to grazing could be explained by the differences in vegetation under light grazing. This would imply that the replacement of deciduous shrubs by graminoids, as a consequence of grazing could be beneficial for C sequestration in tundra soils.

TI Extension of matrix pencil reduction to abelian categories
SO JOURNAL OF ALGEBRA AND ITS APPLICATIONS
LA English
DT Article
DE Matrix pencil; kronecker decomposition; reduction; strangeness
ID DIFFERENTIAL-ALGEBRAIC EQUATIONS
AB Matrix pencils, or pairs of matrices, are used in a variety of applications. By the Kronecker decomposition theorem, they admit a normal form. This normal form consists of four parts, one part based on the Jordan canonical form, one part made of nilpotent matrices, and two other dual parts, which we call the observation and control part. The goal of this paper is to show that large portions of that decomposition are still valid for pairs of morphisms of modules or abelian groups, and more generally in any abelian category. In the vector space case, we recover the full Kronecker decomposition theorem. The main technique is that of reduction, which extends readily to the abelian category case. Reductions naturally arise in two flavors, which are dual to each other. There are a number of properties of those reductions which extend remarkably from the vector space case to abelian categories. First, both types of reduction commute. Second, at each step of the reduction, one can compute three sequences of invariant spaces (objects in the category), which generalize the Kronecker decomposition into nilpotent, observation and control blocks. These sequences indicate whether the system is reduced in one direction or the other. In the category of modules, there is also a relation between these sequences and the resolvent set of the pair of morphisms, which generalizes the regular pencil theorem. We also indicate how this allows to define invariant subspaces in the vector space case, and study the notion of strangeness as an example.

TI The Short Cosyntropin Test Revisited: New Normal Reference Range Using
   LC-MS/MS
SO JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ENDOCRINOLOGY & METABOLISM
LA English

   TEST; STIMULATION; STATEMENT; DIAGNOSIS; ASSAYS
AB The cosyntropin test is used to diagnose adrenal insufficiency (AI) and nonclassical congenital adrenal hyperplasia (NCCAH). Current cutoffs for cortisol and 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP) are derived from nonstandardized immunoassays. Liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) offers direct measurement of steroids, prompting the need to re-establish normal ranges.
   The goal of this study was to define cutoff values for cortisol and 17-OHP in serum by LC-MS/MS 30 and 60 minutes after intravenous administration of 250 A mu g tetracosactide acetate to healthy volunteers and to compare the results with LC-MS/MS with routine immunoassays.
   Cosyntropin testing was performed in healthy subjects (n = 138) and in patients referred for evaluation of adrenocortical function (n = 94). Steroids were assayed by LC-MS/MS and compared with two immunoassays used in routine diagnostics (Immulite and Roche platforms). The cutoff level for cortisol was defined as the 2.5% percentile in healthy subjects not using oral estrogens (n = 121) and for 17-OHP as the 97.5% percentile.
   Cortisol cutoff levels for LC-MS/MS were 412 and 485 nmol/L at 30 and 60 minutes, respectively. Applying the new cutoffs, 13 of 60 (22%) subjects who had AI according to conventional criteria now had a normal test result. For 17-OHP, the cutoff levels were 8.9 and 9.0 nmol/L at 30 and 60 minutes, respectively.
   LC-MS/MS provides cutoff levels for cortisol and 17-OHP after cosyntropin stimulation that are lower than those based on immunoassays, possibly because cross-reactivity between steroid intermediates and cortisol is eliminated. This reduces the number of false-positive tests for AI and false-negative tests for NCCAH.LC-MS/MS-based cut-off levels for s-cortisol and s-17OHP in the cosyntropin stimulation test are lower than recommended in current guidelines, and correlate well with modern immunoassays.

AB Objectives:This study investigated comorbidity in chemical intolerance (CI) and building- related intolerance (BRI) with (i) chronic sinusitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, allergic and nonallergic asthma and allergic rhinitis, and (ii) airway inflammatory symptoms.Methods:Data from two population-based questionnaire surveys, the Vasterbotten and osterbotten Environmental Health Studies, were used. The participants were categorized as CI or BRI and referents, and binary logistic regression analysis was applied.Results:Prevalence rates for the case groups were 7.2% to 40.0% for diseases and 24.3% to 68.9% for symptoms, whereas adjusted odds ratios (ORs) were 3.4 to 26.1 for diseases and 3.3 to 17.0 for symptoms, all being significantly higher than unity. Prevalence rates and ORs were in general higher in BRI than in CI.Conclusion:Inflammatory airway diseases and symptoms are associated with CI and BRI, which encourages further research regarding underlying mechanisms and treatments.

AB The first Committee on Nutrition (CoN) was founded in 1974. Two years later nutrition (N) was added to the society's name, which then became ESPGAN. The Committee systematised compositional and quality criteria for breast milk substitutes and food for special medical purposes, the first of many examples on how recommendations and comments published by the Committees on Nutrition (CsoN) were adopted by the European Economic Community, later the European Union and also influenced the World Health Organization/Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations Codex standards. A second CoN focusing on preterm infants was established in 1979 and its recommendations on nutrition of these infants were widely implemented. The third and standing CoN, established 1986, started to organise high-quality symposia at the annual meetings appreciating the need to enhance the expertise in nutritional research. From 1991 the CoN has organised Summer Schools in paediatric nutrition for young colleagues further emphasising its educational interest and more recently an annual, more specialised Nutrition Masterclass. Successively the interest of the CoN has expanded to other areas, such as highlighting dilemmas and uncertainties in the field of nutrition including the design, choice of outcomes and statistical analysis of trials in infant nutrition. The work of the CsoN have had great impact on paediatric nutrition and the committee will continue its important role by writing commentaries and systematic reviews and revising guidelines when required to inform and stimulate discussion among colleagues as well as stimulate training in paediatric nutrition by organising workshops and scientific meetings, training courses, and other approaches, and by interaction with other expert groups.

AB In this exploratory analysis of AVAglio, a randomized phase III clinical study that investigated the addition of bevacizumab (Bev) to radiotherapy/temozolomide in newly diagnosed glioblastoma, we aim to radiologically characterize glioblastoma on therapy until progression and investigate whether the type of radiologic progression differs between treatment arms and is related to survival and molecular data.
   Five progression types (PTs) were categorized using an adapted algorithm according to MRI contrast enhancement behavior in T1- and T2-weighted images in 621 patients (Bev, n = 299; placebo, n = 322). Frequencies of PTs (designated as classic T1, cT1 relapse, T2 diffuse, T2 circumscribed, and primary nonresponder), time to progression (PFS), and overall survival (OS) were assessed within each treatment arm and compared with molecular subtypes and O-6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation status.
   PT frequencies differed between the Bev and placebo arms, except for "T2 diffuse" (12.4% and 7.1%, respectively). PTs showed differences in PFS and OS; with "T2 diffuse" being associated with longest survival. Complete disappearance of contrast enhancement during treatment ("cT1 relapse") showed longer survival than only partial contrast enhancement decrease ("classic T1"). "T2 diffuse" was more commonly MGMT hypermethylated. Only weak correlations to molecular subtypes from primary tissue were detected.
   Progression of glioblastoma under therapy can be characterized radiologically. These radiologic phenotypes are influenced by treatment and develop differently over time with differential outcomes. Complete resolution of contrast enhancement during treatment is a favorable factor for outcome.

AB Objective: The aim of this study was to determine risk factors for postoperative delirium after cardiac surgery, specifically associated with the conduct of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB).
   Design: Prospective observational study.
   Setting: Heart Centre, University Hospital.
   Participants: The study included 142 patients aged 70 years and older scheduled for elective cardiac surgery with CPB.
   Interventions: Risk factor analysis comprised information collected from the hospital clinical and CPB dedicated databases in addition to the medical chart. Delirium was diagnosed according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition, Text Revision criterion using the Mini Mental State Examination and the Organic Brain Syndrome scale.
   Measurements and Main Results: Assessments of delirium diagnosis were executed preoperatively and on the following first and fourth postoperative days. Delirium occurred in 55% (78/142) of the patients. Patients with delirium were identified with significantly higher body weight and body surface area preoperatively, accompanied with longer CPB time, higher positive fluid balance per CPB, and lower systemic pump flow related to body surface area. Furthermore, the duration of the mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO2) below 75% was significantly longer during CPB. The result from the multivariable logistic regression analysis included the duration of SvO2 below 75%, fluid balance per CPB and patient age as independent risk factors for postoperative delirium.
   Conclusions: The influence of the SvO2 level during CPB, fluid balance, and patient age should be recognized as risk factors for postoperative delirium after cardiac surgery in patients 70 years and older. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB By combining the recently reported repelling natural dihydrostilbene scaffold with an oxime moiety found in many marine antifoulants, a library of nine antifouling hybrid compounds was developed and biologically evaluated. The prepared compounds were shown to display a low antifouling effect against marine bacteria but a high potency against the attachment and growth of microalgae down to MIC values of 0.01 mu g/mL for the most potent hybrid. The mode of action can be characterized as repelling via a reversible non-toxic biostatic mechanism. Barnacle cyprid larval settlement was also inhibited at low mu g/mL concentrations with low levels or no toxicity observed. Several of the prepared compounds performed better than many reported antifouling marine natural products. While several of the prepared compounds are highly active as antifoulants, no apparent synergy is observed by incorporating the oxime functionality into the dihydrostilbene scaffold. This observation is discussed in light of recently reported literature data on related marine natural antifoulants and antifouling hybrids as a potentially general strategy for generation of improved antifoulants.

AB Objective We assessed associations between physical activity and lung function, and its decline, in the prospective population-based European Community Respiratory Health Survey cohort.
   Methods FEV1 and FVC were measured in 3912 participants at 27-57 years and 39-67 years (mean time between examinations= 11.1 years). Physical activity frequency and duration were assessed using questionnaires and used to identify active individuals (physical activity >= 2 times and >= 1 hour per week) at each examination. Adjusted mixed linear regression models assessed associations of regular physical activity with FEV1 and FVC.
   Results Physical activity frequency and duration increased over the study period. In adjusted models, active individuals at the first examination had higher FEV1 (43.6 mL (95% CI 12.0 to 75.1)) and FVC (53.9 mL (95% CI 17.8 to 89.9)) at both examinations than their non-active counterparts. These associations appeared restricted to current smokers. In the whole population, FEV1 and FVC were higher among those who changed from inactive to active during the follow-up (38.0 mL (95% CI 15.8 to 60.3) and 54.2 mL (95% CI 25.1 to 83.3), respectively) and who were consistently active, compared with those consistently non-active. No associations were found for lung function decline.
   Conclusion L eisure-time vigorous physical activity was associated with higher FEV1 and FVC over a 10-year period among current smokers, but not with FEV1 and FVC decline.

AB BACKGROUND: Obesity and related factors have been implicated as possible aetiological factors for the development of glioma in epidemiological observation studies. We used genetic markers in a Mendelian randomisation framework to examine whether obesity-related traits influence glioma risk. This methodology reduces bias from confounding and is not affected by reverse causation.
   METHODS: Genetic instruments were identified for 10 key obesity-related risk factors, and their association with glioma risk was evaluated using data from a genome-wide association study of 12,488 glioma patients and 18,169 controls. The estimated odds ratio of glioma associated with each of the genetically defined obesity-related traits was used to infer evidence for a causal relationship.
   RESULTS: No convincing association with glioma risk was seen for genetic instruments for body mass index, waist-to-hip ratio, lipids, type-2 diabetes, hyperglycaemia or insulin resistance. Similarly, we found no evidence to support a relationship between obesity-related traits with subtypes of glioma-glioblastoma (GBM) or non-GBM tumours.
   CONCLUSIONS: This study provides no evidence to implicate obesity-related factors as causes of glioma.

AB The objective of the study is to analyze procedural and safety outcomes associated with bariatric surgery and describe the characteristics of patients undertaking bariatric procedures in England between April 2006 and March 2012.
   This is a retrospective cohort study of all adult patients in England diagnosed with obesity and undergoing bariatric surgery as a primary procedure in NHS-funded sites between April 2006 and March 2012 using data sourced from the Hospital Episode Statistics dataset. Length of stay (LOS), 30-day readmission, and post-surgery complication were analyzed as primary outcomes. Socio-demographic background, provider type, procedure volume, and comorbidities were all analyzed as potential explanatory variables.
   Gastric bypass (GBP, 12,628) was the most utilized procedure, followed by gastric banding (GB, 6872) and sleeve gastrectomy (SG, 3251). The most prevalent comorbidity was type 2 diabetes (23%). Inpatient mortality was low (ae<currency> 0.15%) for all procedure types. LOS and the risks of both post-operative complication and 30-day readmission were significantly lower for GB, relative to those for GBP and SG. Ethnicity, geographical area, surgery type, and volume were all associated with LOS, risk of readmission, and complication. Provider type and deprivation were further associated with LOS while age correlated with readmission only. An increasing comorbidity burden was associated with an increased risk of both readmission and complication.
   Gastric bypass was the most frequently reported procedure in England across the observation period. While utilization across all procedure types increased between 2007 and 2010, overall uptake of bariatric surgery in England represents only a small proportion of the eligible population. Readmission and complication rates were lower for gastric banding relative to those for either gastric bypass or sleeve gastrectomy. The observed inpatient mortality rate was low across all procedure types.

AB Seasonal cues influence several aspects of the secondary growth of tree stems, including cambial activity, wood chemistry, and transition to latewood formation. We investigated seasonal changes in cambial activity, secondary cell wall formation, and tracheid cell death in woody tissues of Norway spruce (Picea abies) throughout one seasonal cycle. RNA sequencing was performed simultaneously in both the xylem and cambium/phloem tissues of the stem. Principal component analysis revealed gradual shifts in the transcriptomes that followed a chronological order throughout the season. A notable remodeling of the transcriptome was observed in the winter, with many genes having maximal expression during the coldest months of the year. A highly coexpressed set of monolignol biosynthesis genes showed high expression during the period of secondary cell wall formation as well as a second peak in midwinter. This midwinter peak in expression did not trigger lignin deposition, as determined by pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Coexpression consensus network analyses suggested the involvement of transcription factors belonging to the ASYMMETRIC LEAVES2/LATERAL ORGAN BOUNDARIES and MYELOBLASTOSIS-HOMEOBOX families in the seasonal control of secondary cell wall formation of tracheids. Interestingly, the lifetime of the latewood tracheids stretched beyond the winter dormancy period, correlating with a lack of cell death-related gene expression. Our transcriptomic analyses combined with phylogenetic and microscopic analyses also identified the cellulose and lignin biosynthetic genes and putative regulators for latewood formation and tracheid cell death in Norway spruce, providing a toolbox for further physiological and functional assays of these important phase transitions.

AB Chemistry and Human Health, Division VII of the International Union on Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC), provides guidance on risk assessment methodology and, as appropriate, assessment of risks to human health from chemicals of exceptional toxicity. The aim of this document is to describe dose-response relationships for the health effects of low-level exposure to cadmium, in particular, with an emphasis on causation. The term "cadmium" in this document includes all chemical species of cadmium, as well as those in cadmium compounds. Diet is the main source of cadmium exposure in the general population. Smokers and workers in cadmium industries have additional exposure. Adverse effects have been shown in populations with high industrial or environmental exposures. Epidemiological studies in general populations have also reported statistically significant associations with a number of adverse health effects at low exposures. Cadmium is recognized as a human carcinogen, a classification mainly based on occupational studies of lung cancer. Other cancers have been reported, but dose-response relationships cannot be defined. Cardiovascular disease has been associated with cadmium exposure in recent epidemiological studies, but more evidence is needed in order to establish causality. Adequate evidence of dose-response relationships is available for kidney effects. There is a relationship between cadmium exposure and kidney effects in terms of low molecular mass (LMM) proteinuria. Long-term cadmium exposures with urine cadmium of 2 nmol mmol(-1) creatinine cause such effects in a susceptible part of the population. Higher exposures result in increases in the size of these effects. This assessment is supported by toxicokinetic and toxicodynamic (TKTD) modelling. Associations between urine cadmium lower than 2 nmol mmol-1 creatinine and LMM proteinuria are influenced by confounding by co-excretion of cadmium with protein. A number of epidemiological studies, including some on low exposures, have reported statistically significant associations between cadmium exposure and bone demineralization and fracture risk. Exposures leading to urine cadmium of 5 nmol mmol-1 creatinine and more increase the risk of bone effects. Similar associations at much lower urine cadmium levels have been reported. However, complexities in the cause and effect relationship mean that a no-effect level cannot be defined. LMM proteinuria was selected as the critical effect for cadmium, thus identifying the kidney cortex as the critical organ, although bone effects may occur at exposure levels similar to those giving rise to kidney effects. To avoid these effects, population exposures should not exceed that resulting in cadmium values in urine of more than 2 nmol mmol(-1) creatinine. As cadmium is carcinogenic, a 'safe' exposure level cannot be defined. We therefore recommend that cadmium exposures be kept as low as possible. Because the safety margin for toxic effects in kidney and bone is small, or non-existent, in many populations around the world, there is a need to reduce cadmium pollution globally.

AB The aim of this research was to compare two irrigation and N application systems, gun irrigation (GI) and drip fertigation (DF), in terms of soil water dynamics, N uptake, N use efficiency, and yield of table potatoes. Two treatments were set up in a three-year field experiment. Treatments differed by irrigation and N application methods, and scheduling. Water and N management in GI was managed according to typical best-practice while irrigation and N for DF was applied through drip fertigation according to a crop simulation model. Results showed that DF provided high soil water content at the center of the ridge. Average soil water content across the ridge soil profile was higher for DF than GI. Compared to DF, GI led to relatively high canopy growth early in the season through applying all N at planting, while the opposite trend was detected later in the growing season. Tuber yields in GI were 46, 43 and 44 t ha(-1) in 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively. Tuber yields in DF were 48, 43 and 40 t ha(-1) in 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively. There was no significant difference in yield between systems for any of the three seasons of the experiment. However, DF led to significantly higher tuber N recovery and agronomic N use efficiency in one of the years (2013). In addition, GI caused greater nitrate leaching during the growing season in both 2013 and 2014, as measured by suction cups and simulated by the Daisy simulation model.

AB Although research has shown the effects of empathy manipulations on prejudice, little is known about the long-term relation between empathy and prejudice development. the direction of effects, and the relative effects of cognitive and affective aspects of empathy. Moreover, research has not examined within-person processes; hence, its practical implications are unclear. In addition, longitudinal research on development of prejudice and empathy in adolescence is still scarce. This 3-wave study of adolescents (N = 574) examined a longitudinal, within-person relation between empathy and anti-immigrant attitudes. The "standard" cross-lagged model showed bidirectional effects between empathic concern, perspective taking, and anti-immigrant attitudes. In contrast, the Random-Intercept Cross-Lagged Panel Model showed that only perspective taking directly predicted within-person changes in anti-immigrant attitudes. Empathic concern predicted within-person changes in anti-immigrant attitudes indirectly, via its effects on perspective taking. No effects of anti-immigrant attitudes on within-person changes in empathy were found. The relations between empathic concern, perspective taking. and anti-immigrant attitudes were significant at the between-person level. In addition, the results showed changes in anti-immigrant attitudes and perspective taking and a change in empathic concern in mid- but not late adolescence. The results provide strong evidence for the effects of perspective taking on development of anti-immigrant attitudes in adolescence. They also suggest that the link between empathic concern and adolescents' anti-immigrant attitudes can be explained by indirect, within-person effects and by between-person differences. The findings suggest that programs aimed at reducing anti-immigrant attitudes in adolescence should work more closely with youth perspective taking and empathic concern.

TI Methylmercury production in soil in the water-level-fluctuating zone of

AB As important parts of dissolved organic matter, low-molecular-weight organic acids (LMWOAs) typically play important roles in desorbing Hg(II) from the soil solid-phase, which may directly or indirectly impact methylmercury (MeHg) production. However, the mechanism of these processes remains unclear. To better understand the effects of LMWOAs on Hg methylation in the soil, a field study was conducted to investigate the distribution of LMWOAs and their relationship with soil MeHg in a seasonally inundated area in the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR), China. Meanwhile, laboratory simulation experiments were performed to determine the potential mechanism of LMWOAs in Hg methylation. The field investigation detected considerable amounts of LMWOAs in soil, among which tartaric acid and oxalic acid were dominant components. Among which, tartaric acid and oxalic acid were dominant components. Also, a seasonally and spatially heterogeneous distribution of LMWOAs in soil was observed. Notably, a significant positive relationship was found between MeHg concentrations and LMWOA pools in soil (r = 0.969, p < .01), implying that LMWOAs could promote soil MeHg production. The simulation experiments confirmed that the MeHg levels in soil were largely elevated with the addition of LMWOAs, which occurred mainly in oxygen-deficient environment and was mediated by biotic factors. The soluble Hg-LMWOA complexes, which were formed by the enhanced desorption of Hg(II) from solid-phase, were mostly responsible for the elevated MeHg production in soil. Moreover, those LMWOAs with more carboxylic groups were believed to enhance the net production of MeHg. The generated MeHg in sediment could diffuse into the overlying water, which thus poses a potential threat to the aquatic food web. Therefore, the enhanced Hg methylation caused by LMWOAs should be given more attention, especially in a seasonally inundated ecosystem, where the MeHg exposure is usually related to fishery activities.

AB Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal degenerative motor neuron disorder of which the progression is influenced by several disease-modifying factors. Here, we investigated ELP3, a subunit of the elongator complex that modifies tRNA wobble uridines, as one of such ALS disease modifiers. ELP3 attenuated the axonopathy of a mutant SOD1, as well as of a mutant C9orf72 ALS zebrafish model. Furthermore, the expression of ELP3 in the SOD1(G93A) mouse extended the survival and attenuated the denervation in this model. Depletion of ELP3 in vitro reduced the modified tRNA wobble uridine mcm(5)s(2)U and increased abundance of insoluble mutant SOD1, which was reverted by exogenous ELP3 expression. Interestingly, the expression of ELP3 in the motor cortex of ALS patients was reduced and correlated with mcm(5)s(2)U levels. Our results demonstrate that ELP3 is a modifier of ALS and suggest a link between tRNA modification and neurodegeneration.

AB Socioeconomic status (SES) and its association with cancer in general have been thoroughly studied in the last decades. Several studies have shown associations between SES and many types of cancer such as lung cancer, breast cancer, and prostate cancer. For gliomas, no clear occupational or exposure risk factors have been identified, although some possible risk factors such as use of cellular telephone are still controversial. The aim in the present study is to analyze whether there is an association between SES and development of brain cancer. Data from 1999 through 2013 were collected from the Swedish Cancer Registry and from the National Statistics of Sweden. Age-standardized incidence rates for people with different income were calculated using linear regression model. A total of 11,892 patients were included, of which 5675 were meningiomas, 1216 low-grade gliomas, and 5001 high-grade gliomas. No clear trend between increasing incidence rates and higher income was seen in neither of the investigated brain tumor histologies. In conclusion, the results should be interpreted with caution, but there does not seem to be a correlation in this material between increased income and development of brain cancer.

AB Unglaciated forelands and summits protruding from ice-sheets are commonly portrayed as areas where plants first establish at the end of glacial cycles. But is this prevailing view of ice-free refugia too simplistic? Here, we present findings suggesting that surface debris supported plant communities far beyond the rim of the Late Weichselian Ice-sheet during Greenland interstadial 1 (GI-1 or Bolling-Altered interstadial). We base our interpretations upon findings from terrigenous sediments largely resembling 'plant-trash' deposits in North America (known to form as vegetation established on stagnant ice became buried along with glacial debris during the deglaciation). In our studied deposit, we found macrofossils (N = 10) overlapping with the deglaciation period of the area (9.5-10 cal kyr BP) as well as samples (N = 2) with ages ranging between 12.9 and 13.3 cal kyr BP. The latter ages indicate growth of at least graminoids during the GI-1 interstadial when the site was near the geographic center of the degrading ice-sheet. We suggest that exposure of englacial material during GI-1 created patches of supraglacial debris capable of supporting vascular plants three millennia before deglaciation. The composition and resilience of this early plant community remain uncertain. Yet, the younger group of macrofossils, in combination with pollen and ancient DNA analyses of inclusions, imply that shrubs (Salix sp., Betula sp. and Ericaceae sp) and even tree species (Larix) were present in the debris during the final deglaciation stage.

   EXPOSURE
AB Semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs) present in indoor environments are known to cause adverse health effects through multiple routes of exposure. To assess the aggregate exposure, the bioaccessibility and bioavailability of SVOCs need to be determined.
   In this review, we discussed measurements of the bioaccessibility and bioavailability of SVOCs after inhalation. Published literature related to this issue is available for 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin and a few polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, such as benzo[a] pyrene and phenanthrene. Then, we reviewed common modeling approaches for the characterization of the gas-and particle-phase partitioning of SVOCs during inhalation. The models are based on mass transfer mechanisms as well as the structure of the respiratory system, using common computational techniques, such as computational fluid dynamics. However, the existing models are restricted to special conditions and cannot predict SVOC bioaccessibility and bioavailability in the whole respiratory system.
   The present review notes two main challenges for the estimation of SVOC bioaccessibility and bioavailability via inhalation in humans. First, in vitro and in vivo methods need to be developed and validated for a wide range of SVOCs. The in vitro methods should be validated with in vivo tests to evaluate human exposures to SVOCs in airborne particles. Second, modeling approaches for SVOCs need to consider the whole respiratory system. Alterations of the respiratory cycle period and human biological variability may be considered in future studies.

AB Aim: The aim of this study was to explore how patients experienced the recovery process from transcatheter aortic valve implantation.
   Design: A qualitative approach where in-depth interviews were used.
   Method: Eleven men and eight women undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation were individually interviewed 6 months after transcatheter aortic valve implantation. Grounded theory was used for the analysis.
   Results: The analysis generated the core concept "A journey of balancing between life-struggle and hope" connected to descriptive, bipolar categories. Before transcatheter aortic valve implantation patients not only felt threatened but also experienced hope. The rehabilitation phase was described as demanding or surprisingly simple. At the 6 months follow-up patients were pleased to return to life, however, still struggling with limitations. To feel hope is essential for transcatheter aortic valve implantation patients' well-being, both before and during the recovery process. It is important that healthcare professionals not only support hopeful thinking but also take time to discuss and prepare patients, talk about concerns and build confidence. Individual plans for rehabilitation should be designed.

AB Aims and objectives: This study aimed to evaluate Tai Chi group training among patients with chronic heart failure (CHF) aged 70 years and older.
   Background: Physical activity is recommended for CHF treatment. Tai Chi is found to be beneficial to different patient groups, although few studies focus on older patients with CHF.
   Design: A mixed methods study. Participants were randomly assigned to Tai Chi training twice a week for 16 weeks (N=25) or control (N=20). Quantitative data were collected at baseline, at the end of the training period and 6 months after training, assessing self-rated fatigue and quality of life, natriuretic peptides and physical performance. Individual qualitative interviews were conducted with participants (N=10) in the Tai Chi training group.
   Results: No statistical differences between the Tai Chi training group and the control group in quality of life or natriuretic peptides was found. After 16 weeks, the training group tended to rate more reduced activity and the control group rated more mental fatigue. Participants in the training group rated increased general fatigue at follow-up compared with baseline. Qualitative interviews showed that Tai Chi training was experienced as a new, feasible and meaningful activity. The importance of the leader and the group was emphasized. Improvements in balance were mentioned and there was no physical discomfort.
   Conclusion: Tai Chi was experienced as a feasible and meaningful form of physical exercise for patients with CHF aged over 70 years despite lack of achieved health improvement. Further investigations, using feasibility and meaningfulness as outcome variables seems to be useful.

AB A method for simulation of elastoplastic solids in multibody systems with nonsmooth and multidomain dynamics is developed. The solid is discretised into pseudo-particles using the meshfree moving least squares method for computing the strain tensor. The particle's strain and stress tensor variables are mapped to a compliant deformation constraint. The discretised solid model thus fit a unified framework for nonsmooth multidomain dynamics simulations including rigid multibodies with complex kinematic constraints such as articulation joints, unilateral contacts with dry friction, drivelines, and hydraulics. The nonsmooth formulation allows for impact impulses to propagate instantly between the rigid multibody and the solid. Plasticity is introduced through an associative perfectly plastic modified Drucker-Prager model. The elastic and plastic dynamics are verified for simple test systems, and the capability of simulating tracked terrain vehicles driving on a deformable terrain is demonstrated.

AB Flaviviruses are arthropod-borne viruses that constitute a major global health problem, with millions of human infections annually. Their pathogenesis ranges from mild illness to severe manifestations such as hemorrhagic fever and fatal encephalitis. Type I interferons (IFNs) are induced in response to viral infection and stimulate the expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), including that encoding viperin (virus-inhibitory protein, endoplasmic reticulum associated, IFN inducible), which shows antiviral activity against a broad spectrum of viruses, including several flaviviruses. Here we describe a novel antiviral mechanism employed by viperin against two prominent flaviviruses, tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) and Zika virus (ZIKV). Viperin was found to interact and colocalize with the structural proteins premembrane (prM) and envelope (E) of TBEV, as well as with nonstructural (NS) proteins NS2A, NS2B, and NS3. Interestingly, viperin expression reduced the NS3 protein level, and the stability of the other interacting viral proteins, but only in the presence of NS3. We also found that although viperin interacted with NS3 of mosquito-borne flaviviruses (ZIKV, Japanese encephalitis virus, and yellow fever virus), only ZIKV was sensitive to the antiviral effect of viperin. This sensitivity correlated with viperin's ability to induce proteasome-dependent degradation of NS3. ZIKV and TBEV replication was rescued completely when NS3 was overexpressed, suggesting that the viral NS3 is the specific target of viperin. In summary, we present here a novel antiviral mechanism of viperin that is selective for specific viruses in the genus Flavivirus, affording the possible availability of new drug targets that can be used for therapeutic intervention.
   IMPORTANCE Flaviviruses are a group of enveloped RNA viruses that cause severe diseases in humans and animals worldwide, but no antiviral treatment is yet available. Viperin, a host protein produced in response to infection, effectively restricts the replication of several flaviviruses, but the exact molecular mechanisms have not been elucidated. Here we have identified a novel mechanism employed by viperin to inhibit the replication of two flaviviruses: tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) and Zika virus (ZIKV). Viperin induced selective degradation via the proteasome of TBEV and ZIKV non-structural 3 (NS3) protein, which is involved in several steps of the viral life cycle. Furthermore, viperin also reduced the stability of several other viral proteins in a NS3-dependent manner, suggesting a central role of NS3 in viperin's antiflavivirus activity. Taking the results together, our work shows important similarities and differences among the members of the genus Flavivirus and could lead to the possibility of therapeutic intervention.

AB Human adenovirus 41 (HAdV-41) causes acute gastroenteritis in young children. The main characteristics of HAdV-41 infection are diarrhea and vomiting. Nevertheless, the precise mechanism of HAdV-41-induced diarrhea is unknown, as a suitable small-animal model has not been described. In this study, we used the human midgut carcinoid cell line GOT1 to investigate the effect of HAdV-41 infection and the individual HAdV-41 capsid proteins on serotonin release by enterochromaffin cells and on enteric glia cell (EGC) activation. We first determined that HAdV-41 could infect the enterochromaffin cells. Immunofluorescence staining revealed that the cells expressed HAdV-41-specific coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor (CAR); flow cytometry analysis supported these findings. HAdV-41 infection of the enterochromaffin cells induced serotonin secretion dose dependently. In contrast, control infection with HAdV-5 did not induce serotonin secretion in the cells. Confocal microscopy studies of enterochromaffin cells infected with HAdV-41 revealed decreased serotonin immunofluorescence compared to that in uninfected cells. Incubation of the enterochromaffin cells with purified HAdV-41 short fiber knob and hexon proteins increased the serotonin levels in the harvested cell supernatant significantly. HAdV-41 infection could also activate EGCs, as shown in the significantly altered expression of glia fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in EGCs incubated with HAdV-41. The EGCs were also activated by serotonin alone, as shown in the significantly increased GFAP staining intensity. Likewise, EGCs were activated by the cell supernatant of HAdV-41-infected enterochromaffin cells.
   IMPORTANCE The nonenveloped human adenovirus 41 causes diarrhea, vomiting, dehydration, and low-grade fever mainly in children under 2 years of age. Even though acute gastroenteritis is well described, how human adenovirus 41 causes diarrhea is unknown. In our study, we analyzed the effect of human adenovirus 41 infection on human enterochromaffin cells and found it stimulates serotonin secretion in the cells, which is involved in regulation of intestinal secretion and gut motility and can also activate enteric glia cells, which are found in close proximity to enterochromaffin cells in vivo. This disruption of gut barrier homeostasis as maintained by these cells following human adenovirus 41 infection might be a mechanism in enteric adenovirus pathogenesis in humans and could indicate a possible serotonin-dependent cross talk between human adenovirus 41, enterochromaffin cells, and enteric glia cells.

AB OBJECTIVE: Chlamydia trachomatis (C. trachomatis) infection has been suggested to promote epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) development. This study sought to explore the presence of C. trachomatis DNA and chlamydial heat shock protein 60 (chsp60) in ovarian tissue, as well as anti-chlamydial IgG antibodies in plasma, in relation to subtypes of EOC. METHODS: This cross-sectional cohort consisted of 69 women who underwent surgery due to suspected ovarian pathology. Ovarian tissue and corresponding blood samples were collected at the time of diagnosis. In ovarian tumor tissue, p53, p16, Ki67 and chsp60 were analyzed immunohistochemically, and PCR was used to detect C. trachomatis DNA. Plasma C. trachomatis IgG and cHSP60 IgG were analyzed with a commercial MIF-test and ELISA, respectively. RESULTS: Eight out of 69 women had C. trachomatis DNA in their ovarian tissue, all were invasive ovarian cancer cases (16.7% of invasive EOC). The prevalence of the chsp60 protein, C. trachomatis IgG and cHSP60 IgG in HGSC, compared to other ovarian tumors, was 56.0% vs. 37.2% P = .13, 15.4% vs. 9.3% P = .46 and 63.6% vs. 45.5% P = .33 respectively. None of the markers of C. trachomatis infection were associated with p53, p16 or Ki67. CONCLUSIONS: C. trachomatis was detected in invasive ovarian cancer, supporting a possible role in carcinogenesis of EOC. However, there were no statistically significant associations of chsp60 in ovarian tissue, or plasma anti-chlamydial IgG antibodies, with any of the subtypes of ovarian tumors.

LA English
DT Article

AB Objective. To investigate whether periodontitis, characterized by marginal jawbone loss, precedes the onset of symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and to analyze plasma levels of RANKL (a cytokine that is crucial for bone resorption) and anti-citrullinated peptide antibodies (ACPAs) in presymptomatic individuals compared with matched referent controls.
   Methods. Marginal jawbone loss was measured on dental radiographs of the premolar/molar regions in the jaws in 176 subjects, 93 of whom subsequently developed RA. Among these participating subjects, 46 had documented radiographs predating symptom onset, and 45 cases could be matched to controls, according to sex, age, and smoking status. Plasma RANKL concentrations were analyzed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. A receiver operating characteristic curve was used to define the cutoff value for RANKL positivity.
   Results. Bone loss was significantly greater in presymptomatic subjects classified as never smokers compared with that in controls, and increasing levels of bone loss were associated with a higher risk of the subsequent development of RA (hazard ratio 1.03, 95% confidence interval 1.01-1.05). No association between jawbone loss and RA was observed in smokers. A significantly greater extent of marginal jawbone loss was detected in RANKL-positive presymptomatic subjects, and even more pronounced jawbone loss was observed in those who were positive for both RANKL and ACPA.
   Conclusion. Marginal jawbone loss preceded the clinical onset of RA symptoms, but this was observed only in nonsmokers. Moreover, marginal jawbone loss was significantly greater in RANKL-positive presymptomatic subjects compared with RANKL-negative presymptomatic subjects and was highest in presymptomatic subjects positive for both ACPA and RANKL.

AB The Rosetta orbiter witnessed several hundred diamagnetic cavity crossings (unmagnetized regions) around comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko during its two year survey of the comet. The characteristics of the plasma environment inside these diamagnetic regions are studied using in situ measurements by the Rosetta Plasma Consortium instruments. Although the unmagnetized plasma density has been observed to exhibit little dynamics compared to the very dynamical magnetized cometary plasma, we detected several localized dynamic plasma structures inside those diamagnetic regions. These plasma structures are not related to the direct ionization of local cometary neutrals. The structures are found to be steepened, asymmetric plasma enhancements with typical rising-to-descending slope ratio of similar to 2.8 (+/- 1.9), skewness similar to 0.43 (+/- 0.36), mean duration of similar to 2.7 (+/- 0.9) min and relative density variation Delta N/N of similar to 0.5 (+/- 0.2), observed close to the electron exobase. Similar steepened plasma density enhancements were detected at the magnetized boundaries of the diamagnetic cavity as well as outside the diamagnetic region. The plausible scalelength and propagation direction of the structures are estimated from simple plasma dynamics considerations. It is suggested that they are large-scale unmagnetized plasma enhancements, transmitted from the very dynamical outer magnetized region to the inner magnetic field-free cavity region.

AB Objective: To assess excess mortality among suicide attempters compared to the general population.
   Method: Remaining life expectancy was calculated for a nationwide cohort of all 187 894 persons 18 years or older hospitalised for the first time attempted suicide in Sweden in 1971-2010.
   Results: Life expectancy was shortened throughout the lifespan for both men and women debuting with suicide attempt. The reduction in life expectancy for men debuting with a suicide attempt at 20 years of age was 18 years while the reduction for men debuting at 50 years of age was 10 years. For women attempting suicide, the life expectancy was shortened by 11 and 8 years respectively. The gender difference in life expectancy attenuated in patients making their first suicide attempt at age 70 years or older. Suicide deaths explained about 20% of the total mortality within 10 years of the suicide attempt and 5% in those with duration of four decades since the first suicide attempt.
   Conclusion: The life expectancy is dramatically reduced in patients attempting suicide. With most excess deaths being due to physical health conditions, public efforts should be directed both towards improving physical health and to prevent suicide.

AB Repair of large incisional hernias includes the implantation of a synthetic mesh, but this may lead to pain, stiffness, infection and enterocutaneous fistulae. Autologous full-thickness skin graft as on-lay reinforcement has been tested in eight high-risk patients in a proof-of-concept study, with satisfactory results. In this multicenter randomized study, the use of skin graft was compared to synthetic mesh in giant ventral hernia repair.
   Non-smoking patients with a ventral hernia > 10 cm wide were randomized to repair using an on-lay autologous full-thickness skin graft or a synthetic mesh. The primary endpoint was surgical site complications during the first 3 months. A secondary endpoint was patient comfort. Fifty-three patients were included. Clinical evaluation was performed at a 3-month follow-up appointment.
   There were fewer patients in the skin graft group reporting discomfort: 3 (13%) vs. 12 (43%) (p = 0.016). Skin graft patients had less pain and a better general improvement. No difference was seen regarding seroma; 13 (54%) vs. 13 (46%), or subcutaneous wound infection; 5 (20%) vs. 7 (25%). One recurrence appeared in each group. Three patients in the skin graft group and two in the synthetic mesh group were admitted to the intensive care unit.
   No difference was seen for the primary endpoint short-term surgical complication. Full-thickness skin graft appears to be a reliable material for ventral hernia repair producing no more complications than when using synthetic mesh. Patients repaired with a skin graft have less subjective abdominal wall symptoms.

   DesignLongitudinal population-based register study.
   SettingSweden.
   PopulationWomen undergoing benign hysterectomy and/or adnexal surgery in Sweden, 2000-2014, with a previous delivery during 1973-2013 (n=15479).
   MethodsInformation about abdominal adhesions during gynaecological surgery, prior medical history, pregnancies and deliveries were retrieved from Swedish National Health and Quality registers.
   Main outcome measuresAdhesions.
   ResultsIn women with previous CS, adhesions were present in 37%, compared with 10% of women with no previous CS [odds ratio (OR): 5.18, 95% confidence interval (CI): 4.70-5.71]. Adhesions increased with the number of caesarean sections: 32% after one CS; 42% after two CS and 59% after three or more CS (P<0.001). Regardless of the number of CS, factors at CS such as age 35years (aOR: 1.28, 95% CI: 1.05-1.55), body mass index (BMI) 30 [adjusted OR (aOR): 1.91, 95% CI: 1.49-2.45] and postpartum infection (aOR: 1.55, 95% CI: 1.05-2.30) increased the risk of adhesions.
   ConclusionsPresence of adhesions in abdominal gynaecological surgery is associated with women's personal history of caesarean delivery. The number of caesarean sections was the important predictor of adhesions; advanced age, obesity and postpartum infection further increased the incidence.
   Tweetable abstractRepeat caesarean, age, obesity and infection increased the risk of pelvic adhesions after caesarean section.

AB Stigma is an important contributor to the large treatment gap for people with mental and psycho-social disabilities (PPSD) in India. Social distance as assessed by willingness to engage in relationships with PPSD is a proxy measure of stigma and potential discrimination. In North India, investigations of community attitudes towards PPSD have been limited. To describe attitudes towards people with depression and psychosis, a community sample of 960 adults in Dehradun district, India from 30 randomised clusters, was surveyed using a validated tool to assess social distance, beliefs and attitudes related to mental illness. Participants preferred greater social distance from a person with psychosis than a person with depression. Beliefs and attitudes around mental illness were diverse reflecting a wide spread of belief frameworks. After controlling for confounding, there was increased social distance among people who believed PPSD were dangerous. Factors that reduced social distance included familiarity with PPSD, and belief that PPSD can recover. Attitudes to PPSD, stigma and social distance are complex and likely to require complex responses that include promoting awareness of mental health and illness, direct contact with PPSD and increasing access to care for PPSD.

AB The Safe Homes And Respect for Everyone (SHARE) intervention introduced an intimate partner violence (IPV) prevention approach into Rakai Health Sciences Program, an established HIV research and service organization in Uganda. A trial found exposure to SHARE was associated with reductions in IPV and HIV incidence. This mixed methods process evaluation was conducted between August 2007 and December 2009, with people living in SHARE intervention clusters, to assess awareness about/participation in SHARE, motivators and barriers to involvement, and perceptions of how SHARE contributed to behavior change. Surveys were conducted with 1407 Rakai Community Cohort Study participants. Qualitative interviews were conducted with 20 key informants. Most (77%) were aware of SHARE, among whom 73% participated in intervention activities. Two-thirds of those who participated in SHARE felt it influenced behavior change related to IPV. While some felt confident to take part in new IPV-focused activities of a well-established program, others were suspicious of SHARE's motivations, implying awareness raising is critical. Many activities appealed to the majority (e.g., community drama) while interest in some activities was limited to men (e.g., film shows), suggesting multiple intervention components is ideal for wide-reaching programming. The SHARE model offers a promising, acceptable approach for integrating IPV prevention into HIV and other established health programs in sub-Saharan Africa.

   RESPONSES; ATLANTIC; SEA
AB The Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) certification program in Russia is now well established and, in addition to fishery clients and stakeholders, involves environmental NGOs and experts familiar with the local management system. The present study aims to analyze the current status of the program and constitutes the first study covering all Russian MSC certifications. Based on certification reports and twenty semi-structured interviews with stakeholders, it was shown that problems with certification vary among fisheries. The most advanced in terms of management are the Barents Sea codfish fisheries, which are co-managed by Russia and Norway. The main concern of these fisheries is the use of bottom trawls, which may seriously affect bottom communities. The Alaska pollock fishery in the Sea of Okhotsk experienced serious pressure from rival fisheries during the certification process. In the Far East, interviewees dealing with the salmon fisheries note a high level of illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing and insufficient scientific data for comprehensive stock assessment. For small-scale inland perch fisheries from the central part of the country, recreational and illegal fishing are important problems that are difficult to quantify. Many interviewees repeatedly mentioned communication issues, difficulties with access to scientific and management information, and the overall complexity of the MSC certification process. The study shows that important preconditions to expanding certification are making the process manageable for export-oriented companies and developing a national market for sustainable seafood.

AB Hydrogen (H) isotope ratio (H-2) analyses of plant organic compounds have been applied to assess ecohydrological processes in the environment despite a large part of the H-2 variability observed in plant compounds not being fully elucidated. We present a conceptual biochemical model based on empirical H isotope data that we generated in two complementary experiments that clarifies a large part of the unexplained variability in the H-2 values of plant organic compounds. The experiments demonstrate that information recorded in the H-2 values of plant organic compounds goes beyond hydrological signals and can also contain important information on the carbon and energy metabolism of plants. Our model explains where H-2-fractionations occur in the biosynthesis of plant organic compounds and how these H-2-fractionations are tightly coupled to a plant's carbon and energy metabolism. Our model also provides a mechanistic basis to introduce H isotopes in plant organic compounds as a new metabolic proxy for the carbon and energy metabolism of plants and ecosystems. Such a new metabolic proxy has the potential to be applied in a broad range of disciplines, including plant and ecosystem physiology, biogeochemistry and palaeoecology.

AB Background: A negative birth experience may influence both women and men and can limit their process of becoming a parent.
   Aims: This study aimed to analyze and describe women's and men's perceptions and experiences of childbirth.
   Design: A cross-sectional study of women and their partners living in one Swedish county were recruited in mid pregnancy and followed up two months after birth. Women (n = 928) and men (n = 818) completed the same questionnaire that investigated new parents' birth experiences in relation to sociodemographic background and birth related variables.
   Results: Women (6%) and men (3%) with a negative birth experiences, experienced longer labours and more often emergency caesarean section compared to women (94%) and men (97%) with a positive birth experience. The obstetric factors that contributed most strongly to a negative birth experience were emergency caesarean and was found in women (OR 4.7, 95% CI 2.0-10.8) and men (OR 4.5, Cl 95% 1.4-17.3). In addition, pain intensity and elective caesarean section were also associated with a negative birth experiences in women. Feelings during birth such as agreeing with the statement; 'It was a pain to give birth' were a strong contributing factor for both women and men.
   Conclusions: A negative birth experience is associated with obstetric factors such as emergency caesarean section and negative feelings. The content of negative feelings differed between women and men. It is important to take into account that their feelings differ in order to facilitate the processing of the negative birth experience for both partners. (C) 2017 Australian College of Midwives.

AB Despite the strong environmental control of seed dormancy and longevity, their changes along latitudes are poorly understood. The aim of this study was to assess seed dormancy and longevity in different populations across the distribution of the arctic-alpine plant Silene suecica. Seeds of seven populations collected from alpine (Spain, Italy, Scotland) and subarctic (Sweden, Norway) populations were incubated at four temperature regimes and five cold stratification intervals for germination and dormancy testing. Seed longevity was studied by exposing seeds to controlled ageing (45 A degrees C, 60% RH) and regularly sampled for germination. Fresh seeds of S. suecica germinated at warm temperature (20/15 A degrees C) and more in subarctic (80-100%) compared to alpine (20-50%) populations showed a negative correlation with autumn temperature (i.e., post-dispersal period). Seed germination increased after cold stratification in all populations, with different percentages (30-100%). Similarly, there was a large variation of seed longevity (p(50) = 12-32 days), with seeds from the wettest locations showing faster deterioration rate. Subarctic populations of S. suecica were less dormant, showing a warmer suitable temperature range for germination, and a higher germinability than alpine populations. Germination and dormancy were driven by an interplay of geographical and climatic factors, with alpine and warm versus subarctic and cool autumn conditions, eliciting a decrease and an increase of emergence, respectively. Germination and dormancy patterns typically found in alpine habitats may not be found in the arctic.

AB To examine meal patterns in terms of frequency and circadian timing of eating in five European countries participating in the EFCOVAL project.
   In this cross-sectional study, 559 men and women, aged 44-65 years, were recruited in Belgium, the Czech Republic, France (Southern part), The Netherlands, and Norway. Dietary data were collected by trained interviewers using standardized computerised 24-h recalls (GloboDiet). Means +/- SE of (1) eating frequency, (2) overnight fasting, and (3) time between eating occasions were estimated by country using means from 2 days of 24-h recalls. We also estimated the frequency of eating occasions per hour by country as well as the proportional energy intake of meals/snacks by country compared to the mean energy intake of all countries.
   Mean eating frequency ranged from 4.3 times/day in France to 7.1 times/day in The Netherlands (p < 0.05). Mean overnight fasting was shortest in the Netherlands (9.2 h) and longest in Czech Republic (10.9 h) (p < 0.05). Mean time between single eating occasions was shortest in The Netherlands (2.4 h) and longest in France (4.3 h) (p < 0.05). Different patterns of energy intake by meals and snacks throughout the day were observed across the five countries.
   We observed distinct differences in meal patterns across the five European countries included in the current study in terms of frequency and circadian timing of eating, and the proportion of energy intake from eating occasions.

AB Epidemics of dengue, Zika, and other arboviral diseases are increasing in frequency and severity. Current efforts to rapidly identify and manage these epidemics are limited by the short diagnostic window in acute infection, the extensive serologic cross-reactivity among flaviviruses, and the lack of point-of-care diagnostic tools to detect these viral species in primary care settings. The Partnership for Dengue Control organized a workshop to review the current landscape of Flavivirus diagnostic tools, identified current gaps, and developed strategies to accelerate the adoption of promising novel technologies into national programs. The rate-limiting step to bringing new diagnostic tools to the market is access to reference materials and well-characterized clinical samples to facilitate performance evaluation. We suggest the creation of an international laboratory-response consortium for flaviviruses with a decentralized biobank of well-characterized samples to facilitate assay validation. Access to proficiency panels are needed to ensure quality control, in additional to in-country capacity building.

AB The enhancement of platinum (Pt) based catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) by addition of rare earth metals represents a promising strategy to achieve high activity yet low content of the precious metal and concurrently addresses stability issues experienced by traditional late transition metal doping. Improvement in Pt utilization is essential for vehicular applications where material cost and abundancy is a great concern. Here we report a fast and efficient production route of yttria-stabilized platinum nanoparticles (PtxYOy) using a conventional household microwave oven. ORR performance showed a significant improvement and an optimum activity at a 3:1 Pt:Y ratio outperforming that of commercial Pt-Vulcan with a doubled specific activity. Incorporation of Y is evidenced by extended X-ray absorption fine structure and energy dispersive X-ray analysis, while significant amounts of integrated Y2O3 species are detected by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Density functional theory calculations suggest surface migration and oxidation of Y, forming stable superficial yttrium oxide species with low negative enthalpies of formation. The robustness of PtxYOy is shown experimentally and through theoretical arguments demonstrating that surface yttria acts as an stabilizing agent and promoter of highly active ORR sites on the remaining Pt surface, surpassing even the Pt3Y alloy configuration.

SO EUROPEAN UROLOGY

AB Background: There are no conclusive results from randomized trials on radiotherapy (RT) versus radical prostatectomy (RP) for prostate cancer. Numerous observational studies have suggested that RP is associated with a lower risk of prostate cancer death, but whether results have been biased due to limited adjustments for confounding factors is unknown.
   Objective: To compare the risk of prostate cancer death after RT versus RP.
   Design, setting, and participants: Nationwide population-based observational study of men in the Prostate Cancer data Base Sweden 3.0 who had undergone RT or RP between 1998 and 2012.
   Outcome measurements and statistical analysis: Prostate cancer deaths were compared. Hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated in Cox regression models, including clinical T stage, M stage, Gleason grade group, serum levels of prostate-specific antigen, proportion of biopsy cores with cancer, mode of detection, comorbidity, age, educational level, and civil status. Period analysis with left truncation was performed.
   Results and limitations: Primary treatment was RT or RP for 41 503 men. Treatment effect was associated with disease severity. In univariate analysis of RT versus RP, risk of prostate cancer death was higher after RT-low-and intermediate-risk cancer, HR 1.82 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.53-2.16), and high-risk cancer, HR 1.57 (95% CI: 1.33-1.85). After full adjustment in period analysis, this difference between the treatments was attenuated-low-and intermediate-risk cancer, HR 1.24 (95% CI: 0.97-1.58), and high-risk cancer, HR 1.03 (95% CI: 0.81-1.31). Confounding remained due to nonrandom allocation to treatment.
   Conclusions: In comparison with previous studies, the difference in prostate cancer mortality after RT and RP was much smaller.
   Patient summary: The difference in prostate cancer mortality after contemporary radiotherapy and radical prostatectomy was small in contrast to previous studies, indicating that potential side effects should be more emphasized when selecting treatment.

AB Among older adults with a previous fracture, treatment for osteoporosis was initially associated with a higher risk of new fracture. However, the relative risk of new fracture decreased over time, a trend that is consistent with a beneficial effect, as treatment for osteoporosis is prescribed to reduce high fracture risks.
   The purpose of this study was to examine whether bisphosphonate use is associated with a lower risk of new fracture after a clinical fracture in older adults.
   Data were available for 3,329,400 adults in Sweden who were aged ae<yen> 50 years between 2006 and 2011. During this period, 260,353 sustained a clinical fracture and were na < ve to bisphosphonates at the time. Those who subsequently received a bisphosphonate were matched to up to three others on sex, year of birth, and type and year of initial fracture. The final cohort comprised 83,104 adults (26.3% bisphosphonate users).
   During the period from initial fracture to initiation of bisphosphonate treatment, the incidence rate of any new clinical fracture was higher in those who later became bisphosphonate users than in those who remained nonusers (175.1 vs. 75.9 per 1000 person-years; hazard ratio 2.30, 95% confidence interval 2.19 to 2.41). Similarly, during the first 6 months of treatment, the incidence rate was higher in bisphosphonate users than in nonusers (128.8 vs. 90.2 per 1000 person-years; hazard ratio 1.41, 95% confidence interval 1.32 to 1.51). However, this difference decreased over time: by months 12 to 18, the incidence rate was similar in users and nonusers (59.3 vs. 55.3 per 1000 person-years; hazard ratio 1.03, 95% confidence interval 0.91 to 1.16).
   There was a decrease in the relative risk of new fracture during bisphosphonate treatment, a trend that is consistent with a beneficial treatment effect, as bisphosphonates are prescribed to reduce high fracture risks.

ID NUCHAL TRANSLUCENCY
AB IntroductionThe objective of this study was to present the Swedish Pregnancy Register andto explore regional differences in maternal characteristics, antenatal care,first trimester combined screening and delivery outcomes in Sweden.
   Material and methodsThe Pregnancy Register () collects data on pregnancy and childbirth, starting at the first visit to antenatal care and ending at the follow-up visit to the antenatal care, which usually occurs at around 8-16weeks postpartum. The majority of data is collected directly from the electronic medical records. The Register includes demographic, reproductive and maternal health data, as well information on prenatal diagnostics, and pregnancy outcome for the mother and the newborn.
   ResultsToday the Register covers more than 90% of all deliveries in Sweden, with the aim to include all deliveries within 2018. The care providers can visualize quality measures over time and compare results with other clinics, regionally and nationally by creating reports on an aggregated level or using case-mix adjusted Dash Boards in real time. Detailed data can be extracted after ethical approval for research. In this report, we showed regional differences in patient characteristics, antenatal care, fetal diagnosis and delivery outcomes in Sweden.
   ConclusionsOur report indicates that quality in antenatal and delivery care in Sweden varies between regions, which warrants further actions. The Swedish Pregnancy Register is a new and valuable resource for benchmarking, quality improvement and research in pregnancy, fetal diagnosis and delivery.

AB Many elderly people living in nursing homes experience pain and take analgesic medication. The aim of this study was to analyze the prevalence of pain and pharmacological pain treatment among people living in nursing homes in Sweden, in two large, comparable, samples from 2007 to 2013.
   Cross-sectional surveys were performed in 2007 and 2013, including all residents in nursing homes in the county of Vasterbotten, Sweden. A total of 4933 residents (2814 and 2119 respectively) with a mean age of 84.6 and 85.0 years participated. Of these, 71.1 and 72.4% respectively were cognitively impaired. The survey was completed by the staff members who knew the residents best.
   The prescription of opioids became significantly more common while the use of tramadol decreased significantly. The staff reported that 63.4% in 2007 and 62.3% in 2013 had experienced pain. Of those in pain, 20.2% in 2007 and 16.8% in 2013 received no treatment and 73.4 and 75.0% respectively of those with pain, but no pharmacological treatment, were incorrectly described by the staff as being treated for pain.
   There has been a change in the pharmacological analgesic treatment between 2007 and 2013 with less prescribing of tramadol and a greater proportion taking opioids. Nevertheless, undertreatment of pain still occurs and in many cases, staff members believed that the residents were prescribed analgesic treatment when this was not the case.

AB This study investigates how students' reasoning contributes to their utilization of computer-generated feedback. Sixteen 16-year-old students solved a linear function task designed to present a challenge to them using dynamic software, GeoGebra, for assistance. The data were analysed with respect both to character of reasoning and to the use of feedback generated through activities in GeoGebra. The results showed that students who successfully solved the task were engaged in creative reasoning and used feedback extensively.

AB BackgroundAdult critically ill patients often suffer from acute circulatory failure and those with low cardiac output may be treated with inotropic agents. The aim of this Scandinavian Society of Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care Medicine guideline was to present patient-important treatment recommendations on this topic.
   MethodsThis guideline was developed according to GRADE. We assessed the following subpopulations of patients with shock: (1) shock in general, (2) septic shock, (3) cardiogenic shock, (4) hypovolemic shock, (5) shock after cardiac surgery, and (6) other types of shock, including vasodilatory shock. We assessed patient-important outcome measures, including mortality and serious adverse reactions.
   ResultsFor all patients, we suggest against the routine use of any inotropic agent, including dobutamine, as compared to placebo/no treatment (very low quality of evidence). For patients with shock in general, and in those with septic and other types of shock, we suggest using dobutamine rather than levosimendan or epinephrine (very low quality of evidence). For patients with cardiogenic shock and in those with shock after cardiac surgery, we suggest using dobutamine rather than milrinone (very low quality of evidence). For the other clinical questions, we refrained from giving any recommendations or suggestions.
   ConclusionsWe suggest against the routine use of any inotropic agent in adult patients with shock. If used, we suggest using dobutamine rather than other inotropic agents for the majority of patients, however, the quality of evidence was very low, implying high uncertainty on the balance between the benefits and harms of inotropic agents.

AB Despite significant progress in the field, the detection of fMRI signal changes during hallucinatory events remains difficult and time-consuming. This article first proposes a machine-learning algorithm to automatically identify resting-state fMRI periods that precede hallucinations versus periods that do not. When applied to whole-brain fMRI data, state-of-the-art classification methods, such as support vector machines (SVM), yield dense solutions that are difficult to interpret. We proposed to extend the existing sparse classification methods by taking the spatial structure of brain images into account with structured sparsity using the total variation penalty. Based on this approach, we obtained reliable classifying performances associated with interpretable predictive patterns, composed of two clearly identifiable clusters in speech-related brain regions. The variation in transition-to-hallucination functional patterns not only from one patient to another but also from one occurrence to the next (e.g., also depending on the sensory modalities involved) appeared to be the major difficulty when developing effective classifiers. Consequently, second, this article aimed to characterize the variability within the prehallucination patterns using an extension of principal component analysis with spatial constraints. The principal components (PCs) and the associated basis patterns shed light on the intrinsic structures of the variability present in the dataset. Such results are promising in the scope of innovative fMRI-guided therapy for drug-resistant hallucinations, such as fMRI-based neurofeedback.

AB Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) and medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) are characterized by genomic rearrangements and point mutations in the proto-oncogene RET. Leucine-rich repeats and immunoglobulin-like domains 1 (LRIG1) is a suppressor of various receptor tyrosine kinases, including RET. LRIG1 expression levels are associated with patient survival in many cancer types. In the present study, we investigated whether the oncogenic RET mutants RET2A (C634R) and RET2B (M918T) were regulated by LRIG1, and the possible effects of LRIG1 expression in thyroid cancer were investigated in three different clinical cohorts and in a RET2B-driven mouse model of MTC. LRIG1 was shown to physically interact with both RET2A and RET2B and to restrict their ligand-independent activation. LRIG1 mRNA levels were downregulated in PTC and MTC compared to normal thyroid gland tissue. There was no apparent association between LRIG1 RNA or protein expression levels and patient survival in the studied cohorts. The transgenic RET2B mice developed pre-cancerous medullary thyroid lesions at a high frequency (36%); however, no overt cancers were observed. There was no significant difference in the incidence of pre-cancerous lesions between Lrig1 wild-type and Lrig1-deficient RET2B mice. In conclusion, the findings that LRIG1 is a negative regulator of RET2A and RET2B and is also downregulated in PTC and MTC may suggest that LRIG1 functions as a thyroid tumor suppressor.

ID BLEEDING-TIME; ULTRASOUND
AB AimTo evaluate whether the administration of desmopressin alters the risk for renal biopsy complications.
   MethodsA multicenter registry containing 576 native kidney biopsies (NKb) with a serum creatinine above 150mol/L in 527 patients (372 men and 155 women, median age 61years) was used. Most of the data were prospective. At one of the hospitals all biopsies with creatinine above 150mol/L received desmopressin before biopsies (NKb 204). These were compared to outcome of biopsy complications against other centres where desmopressin was not given (NKb 372). Fisher's exact test, (2) analyses, univariate and multiple binary logistic regression were used. Data were given as odds ratio (OR) and confidence interval (CI). A two sided P-value of <0.05 was considered significant.
   ResultsIn NKb with creatinine >150mol/L, those with desmopressin had less overall (3.4% vs 8.4%, OR 0.39, CI 0.17-0.90) whereas major or minor complications were not different. While desmopressin did not exhibit difference in complications in men, women received less major (0% vs 8.6%, P=0.03) and overall complications (0% vs 12.1%, P=0.006). A multiple logistic regression revealed that, after adjusting for BMI, age and sex, prophylaxis with desmopressin showed less major (OR 0.38, CI 0.15-0.96) and overall complications (OR 0.36, CI 0.15-0.85).
   ConclusionDesmopressin given before a native kidney biopsy in patients with impaired renal function can reduce the risk for complications.

ID ACTOR-NETWORK THEORY; POWER
AB Relationships are central to enacting person-centred care of the older person with cognitive impairment. A fuller understanding of relationships and the role they play facilitating wellness and preserving personhood is critical if we are to unleash the productive potential of nursing research and person-centred care. In this article, we target the acute care setting because much of the work about relationships and older people with cognitive impairment has tended to focus on relationships in long-term care. The acute care setting is characterized by archetypal constraints which differentiate it from long-term care, in terms of acuity and haste, task-orientated work patterns and influence from the rule of medicine, all of which can privilege particular types of relating. In this article, we drew on existing conceptualizations of relationships from theory and practice by tapping in to the intellectual resources provided by nurse researchers, the philosophy of Martin Buber and ANT scholars. This involved recounting two examples of dyadic and networked relationships which were re-interpreted using two complementary theoretical approaches to provide deeper and more comprehensive conceptualizations of these relationships. By re-presenting key tenets from the work of key scholars on the topic relationships, we hope to hasten socialization of these ideas into nursing into the acute care setting. First, by enabling nurses to reflect on how they might work toward cultivating relationships that are more salutogenic and consistent with the preservation of personhood. Second, by stimulating two distinct but related lines of research enquiry which focus on dyadic and networked relationships with the older person with cognitive impairment in the acute care setting. We also hope to reconcile the schism that has emerged in the literature between preferred approaches to care of the older person with cognitive impairment, that is person-centred care versus relationship-centred care by arguing that these are complementary rather than mutually exclusive and can be brought together in one theoretical framework acknowledging personhood as relational in essence.

AB Key commentators on person-centred care have described it as a new ethic of care which they link inextricably to notions of individual autonomy, action, change and improvement. Two key points are addressed in this article. The first is that few discussions about ethics and person-centred are underscored by any particular ethical theory. The second point is that despite the espoused benefits of person-centred care, delivery within the acute care setting remains largely aspirational. Choices nurses make about their practice tend to comply more often with prevailing norms than those championed by person-centred care. We draw on elements of work by moral philosopher LOgstrup and Foucault to provide insight into nurses' ethical conduct and ask why nurses would want to act otherwise, when what they think and do is viewed as normal, or think and act otherwise if doing so is seen within the organization as transgressive? To address these more specific questions, we discuss them in relation to the following constructs: the ethical demand, sovereign expressions of life and parrhesia. We conclude by arguing that a ethical theoretical framework enables nurses to increase their perceptibility and appreciation of the ethical demand particularly those emanating from incommensurability between organizational norms and the norms invoked by person-centred care. We argue that nurses' responses to the ethical demand by way of parrhesia can be an important feature of intra-organizational reflexivity and its transformation towards the delivery care that is more person-centred, particularly for older people with cognitive impairment. We conclude the article by highlighting the implications of this for nursing education and research.

AB Vyacheslav Vasilevich (V.V.) Klimov (or Slava, as most of us called him) was born on January 12, 1945 and passed away on May 9, 2017. He began his scientific career at the Bach Institute of Biochemistry of the USSR Academy of Sciences (Akademy Nauk (AN) SSSR), Moscow, Russia, and then, he was associated with the Institute of Photosynthesis, Pushchino, Moscow Region, for about 50 years. He worked in the field of biochemistry and biophysics of photosynthesis. He is known for his studies on the molecular organization of photosystem II (PSII). He was an eminent scientist in the field of photobiology, a well-respected professor, and, above all, an outstanding researcher. Further, he was one of the founding members of the Institute of Photosynthesis in Pushchino, Russia. To most, Slava Klimov was a great human being. He was one of the pioneers of research on the understanding of the mechanism of light energy conversion and of water oxidation in photosynthesis. Slava had many collaborations all over the world, and he is (and will be) very much missed by the scientific community and friends in Russia as well as around the World. We present here a brief biography and some comments on his research in photosynthesis. We remember him as a friendly and enthusiastic person who had an unflagging curiosity and energy to conduct outstanding research in many aspects of photosynthesis, especially that related to PSII.

AB Research has shown that high levels of stress and stress responsivity can increase the risk of injuries. However, most of the research that has supported this notion has focused on between-person relationships, ignoring the relationships at the within-person level. As a result, the objective of this study was to investigate if within-person changes in perceived stress symptoms over a 1-month time period could predict injury rates during the subsequent 3months. A prospective design with two measurement points (Time 1at the beginning of the season and Time 21month into the season) was utilized. A total of 121 competitive soccer players (85 males and 36 females; M-age=18.39, SD=3.08) from Sweden and the United States completed the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (KPDS) and a demographic sheet at Time 1. The KPDS was also completed at Time 2, and all acute injuries that occurred during the subsequent 3-month period were recorded. A Bayesian latent change scores model was used to determine whether within-person changes in stress symptoms could predict the risk of injury. Results revealed that there was a credible positive effect of changes in stress symptoms on injury rates, indicating that an increase in reported stress symptoms was related to an increased risk for injury. This finding highlights the importance of creating caring and supportive sporting environments and relationships and teaching stress management techniques, especially during the earlier portion of competitive seasons, to possibly reduce the occurrence of injuries.

AB Background: Treatment of relapsed childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is particularly challenging due to the high treatment intensity needed to induce and sustain a second remission. To improve results, it is important to understand how treatment-related toxicity impacts survival.
   Procedure: In this retrospective population-based study, we described the causes of death and estimated the risk for treatment-related mortality in patients with first relapse of childhood ALL in the Nordic Society of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology ALL-92 and ALL-2000 trials.
   Results: Among the 483 patients who received relapse treatment with curative intent, we identified 52 patients (10.8%) who died of treatment-related causes. Twelve of these died before achieving second remission and 40 died in second remission. Infections were the cause of death in 38 patients (73.1%), predominantly bacterial infections during the chemotherapy phases of the relapse treatment. Viral infections were more common following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in second remission. Independent risk factors for treatment-related mortality were as follows: high-risk stratification at relapse (hazard ratio [HR] 2.2; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.3-3.9; P < 0.01), unfavorable cytogenetic aberrations (HR 3.4; 95% CI 1.3-9.2; P = 0.01), and HSCT (HR 4.64; 95% CI 2.17-9.92; P < 0.001). In contrast to previous findings, we did not observe any statistically significant sex or age differences. Interestingly, none of the 17 patients with Down syndrome died of treatment-related causes.
   Conclusions: Fatal treatment complications contribute significantly to the poor overall survival after relapse. Implementation of novel therapies with reduced toxicity and aggressive supportive care management are important to improve survival in relapsed childhood ALL.

AB Although adjuvant polychemotherapy improves outcomes for early breast cancer, the significant variability in terms of pharmacokinetics results in differences in efficacy and both short and long-term toxicities. Retrospective studies support the use of dose tailoring according to the hematologic nadirs.
   The SBG 2004-1 trial was a randomized feasibility phase II study which assessed tailored dose-dense epirubicin and cyclophosphamide (EC) followed by docetaxel (T) (group A), the same regimen with fixed doses (group B) and the TAC regimen (group C). Women aged 18-65 years, ECOG PS 0-1 with at least one positive axillary lymph node were randomized 1:1:1. The primary endpoint of the study was the safety and feasibility of the treatment. Toxicity was graded according to CTC-AE version 3.0. The design and short-term toxicity have been previously published. Here, we report safety and efficacy data after 10 years of follow-up.
   A total of 124 patients were included in the study. After a median follow-up of 10.3 years, the probability for 10-year survival was 78.5, 75.1, and 63.4% and for relapse free survival 64.1, 71.0, and 59.5% for groups A, B, and C, respectively. There were no cases of clinically diagnosed cardiotoxicity or hematologic malignancies. No patient was lost to follow-up.
   In this randomized phase II trial, tailored dose adjuvant chemotherapy was feasible, without an increased risk for long-term adverse events after a median follow-up of 10 years.

AB Aims/hypothesis Individuals with type 2 diabetes have aberrant intestinal microbiota. However, recent studies suggest that metformin alters the composition and functional potential of gut microbiota, thereby interfering with the diabetes-related microbial signatures. We tested whether specific gut microbiota profiles are associated with prediabetes (defined as fasting plasma glucose of 6.1-7.0 mmol/l or HbA(1c) of 42-48 mmol/mol [6.0-6.5%]) and a range of clinical biomarkers of poor metabolic health.
   Methods In the present case-control study, we analysed the gut microbiota of 134 Danish adults with prediabetes, overweight, insulin resistance, dyslipidaemia and low-grade inflammation and 134 age-and sex-matched individuals with normal glucose regulation.
   Results We found that five bacterial genera and 36 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were differentially abundant between individuals with prediabetes and those with normal glucose regulation. At the genus level, the abundance of Clostridium was decreased (mean log(2) fold change -0.64 (SEM 0.23), p(adj) = 0.0497), whereas the abundances of Dorea, [ Ruminococcus], Sutterella and Streptococcus were increased (mean log(2) fold change 0.51 (SEM 0.12), p(adj) = 5 x 10(-4); 0.51 (SEM 0.11), p(adj) = 1 x 10-4; 0.60 (SEM 0.21), p(adj) = 0.0497; and 0.92 (SEM0.21), padj = 4 x 10(-4), respectively). The two OTUs that differed the most were a member of the order Clostridiales (OTU 146564) and Akkermansia muciniphila, which both displayed lower abundance among individuals with prediabetes (mean log(2) fold change -1.74 (SEM0.41), p(adj) = 2 x 10(-3) and -1.65 (SEM0.34), p(adj) = 4 x 10(-4), respectively). Faecal transfer from donors with prediabetes or screen-detected, drug-naive type 2 diabetes to germfree Swiss Webster or conventional C57BL/6 J mice did not induce impaired glucose regulation in recipient mice.
   Conclusions/interpretation Collectively, our data show that individuals with prediabetes have aberrant intestinal microbiota characterised by a decreased abundance of the genus Clostridium and the mucin-degrading bacterium A. muciniphila. Our findings are comparable to observations in overt chronic diseases characterised by low-grade inflammation.

AB Aims/hypothesis The aims of the present work were to identify plasma metabolites that predict future type 2 diabetes, to investigate the changes in identified metabolites among individuals who later did or did not develop type 2 diabetes over time, and to assess the extent to which inclusion of predictive metabolites could improve risk prediction.
   Methods We established a nested case-control study within the Swedish prospective population-based Vasterbotten Intervention Programme cohort. Using untargeted liquid chromatography-MS metabolomics, we analysed plasma samples from 503 case-control pairs at baseline (a median time of 7 years prior to diagnosis) and samples from a subset of 187 case-control pairs at 10 years of follow-up. Discriminative metabolites between cases and controls at baseline were optimally selected using a multivariate data analysis pipeline adapted for large-scale metabolomics. Conditional logistic regression was used to assess associations between discriminative metabolites and future type 2 diabetes, adjusting for several known risk factors. Reproducibility of identified metabolites was estimated by intra-class correlation over the 10 year period among the subset of healthy participants; their systematic changes over time in relation to diagnosis among those who developed type 2 diabetes were investigated using mixed models. Risk prediction performance of models made from different predictors was evaluated using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, discrimination improvement index and net reclassification index.
   Results We identified 46 predictive plasma metabolites of type 2 diabetes. Among novel findings, phosphatidylcholines (PCs) containing odd-chain fatty acids (C19: 1 and C17:0) and 2-hydroxyethanesulfonate were associated with the likelihood of developing type 2 diabetes; we also confirmed previously identified predictive biomarkers. Identified metabolites strongly correlated with insulin resistance and/or beta cell dysfunction. Of 46 identified metabolites, 26 showed intermediate to high reproducibility among healthy individuals. Moreover, PCs with odd-chain fatty acids, branched-chain amino acids, 3-methyl-2-oxovaleric acid and glutamate changed over time along with disease progression among diabetes cases. Importantly, we found that a combination of five of the most robustly predictive metabolites significantly improved risk prediction if added to models with an a priori defined set of traditional risk factors, but only a marginal improvement was achieved when using models based on optimally selected traditional risk factors.
   Conclusions/interpretation Predictive metabolites may improve understanding of the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes and reflect disease progression, but they provide limited incremental value in risk prediction beyond optimal use of traditional risk factors.

AB Aims/hypothesis Genetic studies show coupling of genes affecting beta cell function to type 1 diabetes, but hitherto no studies on whether beta cell dysfunction could precede insulitis and clinical onset of type 1 diabetes are available.
   Methods We used 40-day-old BioBreeding (BB) DRLyp/Lyp rats (a model of spontaneous autoimmune type 1 diabetes) and diabetes-resistant DRLyp/+ and DR+/+ littermates (controls) to investigate beta cell function in vivo, and insulin and glucagon secretion in vitro. Beta cell mass was assessed by optical projection tomography (OPT) and morphometry. Additionally, measurements of intra-islet blood flow were performed using microsphere injections. We also assessed immune cell infiltration, cytokine expression in islets (by immunohistochemistry and qPCR), as well as islet Glut2 expression and ATP/ADP ratio to determine effects on glucose uptake and metabolism in beta cells.
   Results DRLyp/Lyp rats were normoglycaemic and without traces of immune cell infiltrates. However, IVGTTs revealed a significant decrease in the acute insulin response to glucose compared with control rats (1685.3 +/- 121.3 vs 633.3 +/- 148.7; p < 0.0001). In agreement, insulin secretion was severely perturbed in isolated islets, and both first- and second-phase insulin release were lowered compared with control rats, while glucagon secretion was similar in both groups. Interestingly, after 5-7 days of culture of islets from DRLyp/Lyp rats in normal media, glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) was improved; although, a significant decrease in GSIS was still evident compared with islets from control rats at this time (7393.9 +/- 1593.7 vs 4416.8 +/- 1230.5 pg islet(-1) h(-1); p < 0.0001). Compared with controls, OPT of whole pancreas from DRLyp/Lyp rats revealed significant reductions in medium (4.1 x 10(9) +/- 9.5 x 10(7) vs 3.8 x 10(9) +/- 5.8 x 10(7) mu m(3); p = 0.044) and small sized islets (1.6 x 10(9) +/- 5.1 x 10(7) vs 1.4 x 10(9) +/- 4.5 x 10(7) mu m(3); p = 0.035). Finally, we found lower intra-islet blood perfusion in vivo (113.1 +/- 16.8 vs 76.9 +/- 11.8 mu l min(-1) [g pancreas](-1); p = 0.023) and alterations in the beta cell ATP/ADP ratio in DRLyp/Lyp rats vs control rats.
   Conclusions/interpretation The present study identifies a deterioration of beta cell function and mass, and intra-islet blood flow that precedes insulitis and diabetes development in animals prone to autoimmune type 1 diabetes. These underlying changes in islet function may be previously unrecognised factors of importance in type 1 diabetes development.

AB To be successful in a high-stakes testing situation is desirable for any test taker. It has been found that, beside content knowledge, test-taking behavior, such as risk-taking strategies, motivation, and test anxiety, is important for test performance. The purposes of the present study were to identify and group test takers with similar patterns of test-taking behavior and to explore how these groups differ in terms of background characteristics and test performance in a high-stakes achievement test context. A sample of the Swedish Scholastic Assessment Test test takers (N = 1891) completed a questionnaire measuring their motivation, test anxiety, and risk-taking behavior during the test, as well as background characteristics. A two-step cluster analysis revealed three clusters of test takers with significantly different test-taking behavior profiles: a moderate (n = 741), a calm risk taker (n = 637), and a test anxious risk averse (n = 513) profile. Group difference analyses showed that the calm risk taker profile (i.e., a high degree of risk-taking together with relatively low levels of test anxiety and motivation during the test) was the most successful profile from a test performance perspective, while the test anxious risk averse profile (i.e., a low degree of risk-taking together with high levels of test anxiety and motivation) was the least successful. Informing prospective test takers about these insights can potentially lead to more valid interpretations and inferences based on the test scores.

AB Epidemiological studies have consistently shown associations between elevated concentrations of urban particulate matter (UPM) air pollution and exacerbations of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, which are both associated with viral respiratory infections. The effects of UPM on dendritic cell (DC) -stimulated CD4 T lymphocytes have been investigated previously, but little work has focused on CD8 T-lymphocyte responses despite their importance in anti-viral immunity. To address this, we examined the effects of UPM on DC-stimulated naive CD8 T-cell responses. Expression of the maturation/activation markers CD83, CCR7, CD40 and MHC class I on human myeloid DCs (mDCs) was characterized by flow cytometry after stimulation with UPMin vitro in the presence/absence of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). The capacity of these mDCs to stimulate naive CD8 T-lymphocyte responses in allogeneic co-culture was then assessed by measuring T-cell cytokine secretion using cytometric bead array, and proliferation and frequency of interferon- (IFN-)-producing T lymphocytes by flow cytometry. Treatment of mDCs with UPM increased expression of CD83 and CCR7, but not MHC class I. In allogeneic co-cultures, UPM treatment of mDCs enhanced CD8 T-cell proliferation and the frequency of IFN-(+) cells. The secretion of tumour necrosis factor-, interleukin-13, Granzyme A and Granzyme B were also increased. GM-CSF alone, and in concert with UPM, enhanced many of these T-cell functions. The PM-induced increase in Granzyme A was confirmed in a human experimental diesel exposure study. These data demonstrate that UPM treatment of mDCs enhances priming of naive CD8 T lymphocytes and increases production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Such UPM-induced stimulation of CD8 cells may potentiate T-lymphocyte cytotoxic responses upon concurrent airway infection, increasing bystander damage to the airways.

AB Storytelling has been shown to play a key role in transferring work experience from more experienced towards novices in a number of vocational educational practices, however previous studies have not to the same extent dealt with the role of students' own storytelling practices for sensemaking of work experience. This study set out to examine police students' storytelling of their first occupational experiences from a sensemaking perspective, with an analysis drawing on the concepts of enactment, selection, and retention. The study is based on participant observations of field training follow up sessions' in the context of police education. Findings indicated that student storytelling of work experience tended to be geared towards action, extremeness and the telling of 'war stories'. Furthermore, these type of stories functioned to enable student identification, self-enhancement and emotion management. These findings contribute to our current understanding of how students engage in sensemaking of work-based experiences and in extension how knowledge integration and learning from work placements can be structured pedagogically.

AB The classic model of nitrogen (N) flux into roots is as a Michaelis-Menten (MM) function of soil-N concentration at root surfaces. Furthermore, soil-N transport processes that determine soil-N concentration at root surfaces are seen as a bottleneck for plant nutrition. Yet, neither the MM relationship nor soil-N transport mechanisms are represented in current terrestrial biosphere models. Processes governing N supply to roots - diffusion, mass flow, N immobilization by soil microbes - are incorporated in a model of root-N uptake. We highlight a seldom considered interaction between these processes: nutrient traverses the rhizosphere more quickly in the presence of mass flow, reducing the probability of its immobilization before reaching the root surface. Root-N uptake is sensitive to the rate of mass flow for widely spaced roots with high N uptake capacity, but not for closely spaced roots or roots with low uptake capacity. The results point to a benefit of root switching from high- to low-affinity N transport systems in the presence of mass flow. Simulations indicate a strong impact of soil water uptake on N delivery to widely spaced roots through transpirationally driven mass flow. Furthermore, a given rate of N uptake per unit soil volume may be achieved by lower root biomass in the presence of mass flow.

AB ObjectivesIt remains unclear to what extent postoperative delirium (POD) affects the incidence of dementia in hip fracture patients, and the methods used to detect delirium and dementia require validation. The aim of this study was to investigate the development of dementia within 3years of femoral neck fracture repair surgery, with a focus on POD as a potential predictive factor.
   MethodsPatients were assessed for cognition, delirium, depression, psychological well-being, and nutritional status during their hospitalization as well as 4, 12, and 36months after the operation. Logistic regression models were used to analyse factors associated with POD and factors associated with the development of dementia.
   ResultsThe study sample consisted of 135 patients without a history of dementia, of whom 20 (14.8%) were delirious preoperatively and 75 (55.5%) postoperatively. Three years after their operations, 43/135 patients (31.8%) were diagnosed with dementia. A greater portion of patients diagnosed with dementia (39/43, 90.6%) than patients with no dementia (36/92, 39.1%) were included among the 75 patients who had experienced POD (P<0.001). In a logistic regression model, after adjustment for covariates (age, sex, diabetes, delirium pre-and postoperatively, hyperactive delirium, days with delirium, urinary tract infection, and Mini Nutritional Assessment score), POD emerged an independent predictor for the development of new dementia (odds ratio, 15.6; 95% confidence interval, 2.6-91.6) within 3years after the operation.
   ConclusionGeriatric hip fracture patients who exhibit POD should be monitored closely for the development of dementia.

AB Carbon nitride (C-N) materials have been attracting great interest because of their extraordinary performance in photocatalysis and energy conversion. However, developing an effective strategy for achieving band-gap engineering of C-N materials to satisfy practical applications remains highly desired. Here we report an efficient way to tune the band gap and control the nitrogen stoichiometry in carbon nitride compounds by using high pressure and high temperature (HPHT) treatment. It is found that treating a g-C3N4 precursor at relatively low temperature (630 degrees C and below) under pressure can efficiently narrow the band gap even down to the red light region (similar to 600 nm), increase the crystallinity, and significantly improve the charge carrier separation efficiency (by two orders of magnitude), almost without changing their stoichiometry. When increasing the treatment temperature under pressure, nitrogen-doped graphene/graphite materials with weak ferromagnetism were obtained. We thus obtained C-N materials with tunable band gaps, ranging from semiconducting to metallic states. XPS measurements show that pyridinic nitrogen is preferentially eliminated under such HPHT conditions while graphitic nitrogen is preserved in the C-N network. Our results thus provide an efficient strategy for tuning the structure and physical properties of C-N materials for applications. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Tree growth response to recent environmental changes is of key interest for forest ecology. This study addressed the following questions with respect to Norway spruce (Picea abies, L. Karst.) in Central Europe: Has tree growth accelerated during the last five decades? What are the main environmental drivers of the observed tree radial stem growth and how much variability can be explained by them? Using a nationwide dendrochronological sampling of Norway spruce in the Czech Republic (1246 trees, 266 plots), novel regional tree-ring width chronologies for 40(+/- 10)- and 60(+/- 10)- year old trees were assembled, averaged across three elevation zones (break points at 500 and 700 m). Correspondingly averaged drivers, including temperature, precipitation, nitrogen (N) deposition and ambient CO2 concentration, were used in a general linear model (GLM) to analyze the contribution of these in explaining tree ring width variability for the period from 1961 to 2013. Spruce tree radial stem growth responded strongly to the changing environment in Central Europe during the period, with a mean tree ring width increase of 24 and 32% for the 40- and 60-year old trees, respectively. The indicative General Linear Model analysis identified CO2, precipitation during the vegetation season, spring air temperature (March-May) and N-deposition as the significant covariates of growth, with the latter including interactions with elevation zones. The regression models explained 57% and 55% of the variability in the two tree ring width chronologies, respectively. Growth response to N-deposition showed the highest variability along the elevation gradient with growth stimulation/limitation at sites below/above 700 m. A strong sensitivity of stemgrowth to CO2 was also indicated, suggesting that the effect of rising ambient CO2 concentration (direct or indirect by increased water use efficiency) should be considered in analyses of long-term growth together with climatic factors and N-deposition.

AB Other than the influence of ionizing radiation and benign thyroid disease, little is known about the risk factors for differentiated thyroid cancer (TC) which is an increasing common cancer worldwide. Consistent evidence shows that body mass is positively associated with TC risk. As excess weight is a state of chronic inflammation, we investigated the relationship between concentrations of leptin, adiponectin, C-reactive protein, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and the risk of TC. A case-control study was nested within the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) study and included 475 first primary incident TC cases (399 women and 76 men) and 1,016 matched cancer-free cohort participants. Biomarkers were measured in serum samples using validated and highly sensitive commercially available immunoassays. Odds ratios (ORs) of TC by levels of each biomarker were estimated using conditional logistic regression models, adjusting for BMI and alcohol consumption. Adiponectin was inversely associated with TC risk among women (ORT3vs.T1=0.69, 95% CI: 0.49-0.98, P-trend=0.04) but not among men (ORT3vs.T1=1.36, 95% CI: 0.67-2.76, P-trend=0.37). Increasing levels of IL-10 were positively associated with TC risk in both genders and significantly so in women (ORT3vs.T1=1.59, 95% CI: 1.13-2.25, P-trend=0.01) but not in men (ORT3vs.T1=1.78, 95% CI: 0.80-3.98, P-trend=0.17). Leptin, CRP, IL-6 and TNF-alpha were not associated with TC risk in either gender. These results indicate a positive association of TC risk with IL-10 and a negative association with adiponectin that is probably restricted to women. Inflammation may play a role in TC in combination with or independently of excess weight.
   What's new?
   How does being overweight lead to thyroid cancer? These authors investigated, using data from the EPIC cohort. Considering obesity as a state of chronic inflammation, they looked at levels of various proteins associated with inflammation, including C-reactive protein, IL-10, adiponectin, and others, and compared these with TC risk. Women with high adiponectin levels were less likely to develop thyroid cancer, while those with high IL-10 levels had increased TC risk. No significant association was seen in men.

TI Ovarian cancer early detection by circulating CA125 in the context of
   anti-CA125 autoantibody levels: Results from the EPIC cohort

AB CA125 is the best ovarian cancer early detection marker to date; however, sensitivity is limited and complementary markers are required to improve discrimination between ovarian cancer cases and non-cases. Anti-CA125 autoantibodies are observed in circulation. Our objective was to evaluate whether these antibodies (1) can serve as early detection markers, providing evidence of an immune response to a developing tumor, and (2) modify the discriminatory capacity of CA125 by either masking CA125 levels (resulting in lower discrimination) or acting synergistically to improve discrimination between cases and non-cases. We investigated these objectives using a nested case-control study within the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition cohort (EPIC) including 250 cases diagnosed within 4 years of blood collection and up to four matched controls. Circulating CA125 antigen and antibody levels were quantified using an electrochemiluminescence assay. Adjusted areas under the curve (aAUCs) by 2-year lag-time intervals were calculated using conditional logistic regression calibrated toward the absolute risk estimates from a pre-existing epidemiological risk model as an offset-variable. Anti-CA125 levels alone did not discriminate cases from controls. For cases diagnosed <2 years after blood collection, discrimination by CA125 antigen was suggestively higher with higher anti-CA125 levels (aAUC, highest antibody tertile: 0.84 [0.76-0.92]; lowest tertile: 0.76 [0.67-0.86]; p(het)=0.06). We provide the first evidence of potentially synergistic discrimination effects of CA125 and anti-CA125 antibodies in ovarian early detection. If these findings are replicated, evaluating CA125 in the context of its antibody may improve ovarian cancer early detection.
   What's new?
   Although CA125, a mucin produced in epithelial cells, is a known marker for ovarian cancer, complementary biomarkers are necessary for reliable early cancer detection. Here, the authors examined autoantibodies against CA125 as potential pre-diagnosis markers. Although anti-CA125 levels did not discriminate between ovarian cases and controls, discrimination of CA125 differed by levels of its antibody, with the highest discrimination among women with the highest antibody levels. The authors propose that CA125 and anti-CA125 may act synergistically for ovarian cancer early detection.

DE Power-performance tradeoffs; Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling
   (DVFS); CPU pinning; Horizontal scaling; Vertical scaling
ID ELASTICITY
AB Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS), CPU pinning, horizontal, and vertical scaling, are four techniques that have been proposed as actuators to control the performance and energy consumption on data center servers. This work investigates the utility of these four actuators, and quantifies the power-performance tradeoffs associated with them. Using replicas of the German Wikipedia running on our local testbed, we perform a set of experiments to quantify the influence of DVFS, vertical and horizontal scaling, and CPU pinning on end-to-end response time (average and tail), throughput, and power consumption with different workloads. Results of the experiments show that DVFS rarely reduces the power consumption of underloaded servers by more than 5%, but it can be used to limit the maximal power consumption of a saturated server by up to 20% (at a cost of performance degradation). CPU pinning reduces the power consumption of underloaded server (by up to 7%) at the cost of performance degradation, which can be limited by choosing an appropriate CPU pinning scheme. Horizontal and vertical scaling improves both the average and tail response time, but the improvement is not proportional to the amount of resources added. The load balancing strategy has a big impact on the tail response time of horizontally scaled applications. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID INCOME-RELATED INEQUALITIES; FINANCIAL CRISIS; CARE SERVICES; OECD
   COUNTRIES; MENTAL-HEALTH; DELIVERY; EUROPE; SYSTEM; SECTOR; POPULATION
AB Scant research is available on the impact of the current economic crisis and austerity policies on inequality in health services utilisation in Europe. This study aimed to describe the trends in horizontal inequity in the use of health services in Andalusia, Spain, during the early years of the Great Recession, and the contribution of demographic, economic and social factors. Consultation with a general practitioner (GP) and specialist, hospitalisation and emergency care were studied through the Andalusian Health Survey 2007 (pre-crisis) and 2011-2012 (crisis), using a composite income index as socioeconomic status (SES) indicator. Horizontal inequity indices (HII) were calculated to take differential healthcare needs into account, and a decomposition analysis of change in inequality between periods was performed. Results showed that before the crisis, the HII was positive (greater access for people with higher SES) for specialist visits but negative (greater access for people with lower SES) in the other three utilisation models. During the crisis no change was observed in inequalities in GP visits, but a pro-poor development was seen for the other types of utilisation, with hospital and emergency care showing significant inequality in favour of low income groups. Overall, the main contributors to pro-poor changes in utilisation were socioeconomic variables and poor mental health, due to changes in their elasticities. Our findings show that inequalities in healthcare utilisation largely remained in favour of the less well-off, despite the cuts in welfare benefits and health services provision during the early years of the recession in Andalusia. Further research is needed to monitor the potential impact of such measures in subsequent years.

AB Objectives: To compare medical students' and residents' knowledge retention of assessment, diagnosis and treatment procedures, as well as a learning experience, of patients with spinal trauma after training with either a Virtual Patient case or a video-recorded traditional lecture.
   Methods: A total of 170 volunteers (85 medical students and 85 residents in orthopedic surgery) were randomly allocated (stratified for student/resident and gender) to either a video-recorded standard lecture or a Virtual Patient-based training session where they interactively assessed a clinical case portraying a motorcycle accident. The knowledge retention was assessed by a test immediately following the educational intervention and repeated after a minimum of 2 months. Participants' learning experiences were evaluated with exit questionnaires. A repeated-measures analysis of variance was applied on knowledge scores. A total of 81% (n = 138) of the participants completed both tests.
   Results: There was a small but significant decline in first and second test results for both groups (F-(1,F-135) = 18.154, p = 0.00). However, no significant differences in short-term and long-term knowledge retention were observed between the two teaching methods. The Virtual Patient group reported higher learning experience levels in engagement, stimulation, general perception, and expectations.
   Conclusions: Participants' levels engagement were reported in favor of the VP format. Similar knowledge retention was achieved through either a Virtual Patient or a recorded lecture.

   HEPARIN; EXPRESSION; INFLAMMATION; COAGULATION
AB Ischemia reperfusion injury is one of the major complications responsible for delayed graft function in kidney transplantation. Applications to reduce reperfusion injury are essential due to the widespread use of kidneys from deceased organ donors where the risk for delayed graft function is especially prominent. We have recently shown that coating of inflamed or damaged endothelial cells with a unique heparin conjugate reduces thrombosis and leukocyte recruitment. In this study we evaluated the binding capacity of the heparin conjugate to cultured human endothelial cells, to kidneys from brain-dead porcine donors, and to murine kidneys during static cold storage. The heparin conjugate was able to stably bind cultured endothelial cells with high avidity, and to the renal vasculature of explanted kidneys from pigs and mice. Treatment of murine kidneys prior to transplantation reduced platelet deposition and leukocyte infiltration 24 hours post-transplantation, and significantly improved graft function. The present study thus shows the benefits of enhanced protection of the renal vasculature during cold storage, whereby increasing the antithrombotic and anti-adhesive properties of the vascular endothelium yields improved renal function early after transplantation.

TI Rating experiments in forestry: How much agreement is there in tree

AB The process of selecting individual trees by humans for forest management purposes is the result of a plethora of factors and processes that are hard to disentangle. And yet in the past many textbooks and other publications have maintained that this selection leads to somewhat unanimous results. In this study, we analysed the data of 36 so-called marteloscope experiments from all over Britain, which are managed by the Ae Training Centre (Scotland, UK). Our objective was (1) to establish how much agreement there actually was when asking test persons (raters) to apply two different thinning methods, low and crown thinning. In addition we (2) were interested in understanding some of the processes leading to certain levels of agreement and in relationships between the agreement measures and characteristics of forest structure. Our analysis was based on multivariate statistics, particularly using Fleiss' kappa. This was the first time that an analysis of rater behaviour was performed at such a large scale and it revealed that the general agreement in tree selection in Britain was only slight to fair, i.e. much lower than in medical experiments. The variability of selecting individual trees was considerable. We also found that agreement in tree selection was much stronger in low-thinning as opposed to crown-thinning experiments. As the latter is an important method of Continuous Cover Forestry and British forestry is increasingly adopting this forest management type, our results suggested that there is a need to provide more training. Interestingly the different levels of agreement as identified by Fleiss' kappa could not be explained by measures of forest structure, however, the mean conformity number, a surrogate of Fleiss' kappa, showed correlations and indicated that conformity increased with increasing complexity of tree stem diameter structure.

AB Background: The amount a government should be willing to invest in adopting new medical treatments has long been under debate. With many countries using formal cost-effectiveness (C/E) thresholds when examining potential new treatments and ever-growing medical costs, accurately setting the level of a C/E threshold can be essential for an efficient healthcare system.Objectives: The aim of this systematic review is to describe the prominent approaches to setting a C/E threshold, compile available national-level C/E threshold data and willingness-to-pay (WTP) data, and to discern whether associations exist between these values, gross domestic product (GDP) and health-adjusted life expectancy (HALE). This review further examines current obstacles faced with the presently available data.Methods: A systematic review was performed to collect articles which have studied national C/E thresholds and willingness-to-pay (WTP) per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) in the general population. Associations between GDP, HALE, WTP, and C/E thresholds were analyzed with correlations.Results: Seventeen countries were identified from nine unique sources to have formal C/E thresholds within our inclusion criteria. Thirteen countries from nine sources were identified to have WTP per QALY data within our inclusion criteria. Two possible associations were identified: C/E thresholds with HALE (quadratic correlation of 0.63), and C/E thresholds with GDP per capita (polynomial correlation of 0.84). However, these results are based on few observations and therefore firm conclusions cannot be made.Conclusions: Most national C/E thresholds identified in our review fall within the WHO's recommended range of one-to-three times GDP per capita. However, the quality and quantity of data available regarding national average WTP per QALY, opportunity costs, and C/E thresholds is poor in comparison to the importance of adequate investment in healthcare. There exists an obvious risk that countries might either over- or underinvest in healthcare if they base their decision-making process on erroneous presumptions or non-evidence-based methodologies. The commonly referred to value of 100,000$ USD per QALY may potentially have some basis.

AB Monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL) is the principle enzyme for metabolizing endogenous cannabinoid ligand 2-arachidonoyglycerol (2-AG). Blockade of MAGL increases 2-AG levels, resulting in subsequent activation of the endocannabinoid system, and has emerged as a novel therapeutic strategy to treat drug addiction, inflammation, and neurodegenerative diseases. Herein we report a new series of MAGL inhibitors, which were radiolabeled by site-specific labeling technologies, including C-11-carbonylation and spirocyclic iodonium ylide (SCIDY) radio fluorination. The lead compound [C-11]10 (MAGL-0519) demonstrated high specific binding and selectivity in vitro and in vivo. We also observed unexpected washout kinetics with these irreversible radiotracers, in which in vivo evidence for turnover of the covalent residue was unveiled between MAGL and azetidine carboxylates. This work may lead to new directions for drug discovery and PET tracer development based on azetidine carboxylate inhibitor scaffold.

AB This study examined the relation between perceived stress and time perspective (views of past, present, future) in a population-based sample of older adults (65-90 years, N = 340). The Perceived Questionnaire (PSQ index) was used to measure stress and the Swedish version of the Zimbardo Time Perspective Inventory (S-ZTPI) was used to operationalize time perspective. Unlike the original inventory, S-ZTPI separates positive and negative aspects of a future time perspective and we hypothesized that the Future Negative (FN) scale would be important to account for variations in stress. Additionally, associations with Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) Val(158)Met polymorphism were examined, motivated by prior associations of this single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) with stress (or "anxiety") related personality traits. In line with the hypotheses, FN was the strongest predictor of PSQ index scores in multiple regression analyses. In a related vein, the dichotomization of the unitary Future scale increased the association between PSQ scores and a measure of deviations from a balanced time perspective, i.e., the difference between a proposed optimal and observed ZTPI profile. Finally, higher levels of stress as well as higher scores on FN were observed in COMT Val/Val carriers, at least among men. This suggests a shared dopaminergic genetic influence on these variables. Collectively, the results demonstrate that perceived stress is closely linked to time perspective and highlight the need to take negative aspects of a future temporal orientation into account to understand this relation.

AB Measurements of carbon isotope contents of plant organic matter provide important information in diverse fields such as plant breeding, ecophysiology, biogeochemistry and paleoclimatology. They are currently based on C-13/C-12 ratios of specific, whole metabolites, but we show here that intramolecular ratios provide higher resolution information. In the glucose units of tree-ring cellulose of 12 tree species, we detected large differences in C-13/C-12 ratios (>10%) among carbon atoms, which provide isotopically distinct inputs to major global C pools, including wood and soil organic matter. Thus, considering position-specific differences can improve characterisation of soil-to-atmosphere carbon fluxes and soil metabolism. In a Pinus nigra tree-ring archive formed from 1961 to 1995, we found novel C-13 signals, and show that intramolecular analysis enables more comprehensive and precise signal extraction from tree rings, and thus higher resolution reconstruction of plants' responses to climate change. Moreover, we propose an ecophysiological mechanism for the introduction of a C-13 signal, which links an environmental shift to the triggered metabolic shift and its intramolecular C-13 signature. In conclusion, intramolecular C-13 analyses can provide valuable new information about long-term metabolic dynamics for numerous applications.

AB Bovine milk intake has been associated with various disease outcomes, with modulation of the gastro-intestinal microbiome being suggested as one potential mechanism. The aim of the present study was to explore the oral microbiota in relation to variation in self-reported milk intake. Saliva and tooth biofilm microbiota was characterized by 16S rDNA sequencing, PCR and cultivation in 154 Swedish adolescents, and information on diet and other lifestyle markers were obtained from a questionnaire, and dental caries from clinical examination. A replication cohort of 31,571 adults with similar information on diet intake, other lifestyle markers and caries was also studied. Multivariate partial least squares (PLS) modelling separated adolescents with low milk intake (lowest tertile with <0.4 servings/day) apart from those with high intake of milk (>= 3.7 servings/day) based on saliva and tooth biofilm, respectively. Taxa in several genera contributed to this separation, and milk intake was inversely associated with the caries causing Streptococcus mutans in saliva and tooth biofilm samples by sequencing, PCR and cultivation. Despite the difference in S. mutans colonization, caries prevalence did not differ between milk consumption groups in the adolescents or the adults in the replication cohort, which may reflect that a significant positive association between intake of milk and sweet products was present in both the study and replication group. It was concluded that high milk intake correlates with different oral microbiota and it is hypothesized that milk may confer similar effects in the gut. The study also illustrated that reduction of one single disease associated bacterial species, such as S. mutans by milk intake, may modulate but not prevent development of complex diseases, such as caries, due to adverse effects from other causal factors, such as sugar intake in the present study.

AB Epoxidation of oleic acid and cottonseed oil was conducted in a semibatch reactor with in-situ-formed percarboxylic acid (peracetic acid or perpropionic acid), using hydrogen peroxide as an oxidizing agent and carboxylic acid (acetic acid or propionic acid) as oxygen carriers. Amberlite IR-120 was implemented as the catalyst. The system was comprised of a loop reactor, where the mixture was pumped through a single-mode cavity in which microwave irradiation was introduced. A heat exchanger was integrated into the system to replace microwave heating, to compare the results obtained via microwave heating versus conventional heating. The catalyst loading effect was studied, as well as the influence of microwave irradiation and the implementation of the SpinChem rotating bed reactor (RBR), in hopes of decreasing the influence of the internal mass transfer. The application of microwave irradiation results in an improvement of the reaction yield in the absence of a catalyst.

AB To identify novel genes associated with ALS, we undertook two lines of investigation. We carried out a genome-wide association study comparing 20,806 ALS cases and 59,804 controls. Independently, we performed a rare variant burden analysis comparing 1,138 index familial ALS cases and 19,494 controls. Through both approaches, we identified kinesin family member 5A (KIF5A) as a novel gene associated with ALS. Interestingly, mutations predominantly in the N-terminal motor domain of KIF5A are causative for two neurodegenerative diseases: hereditary spastic paraplegia (SPG10) and Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 2 (CMT2). In contrast, ALS-associated mutations are primarily located at the C-terminal cargo-binding tail domain and patients harboring loss-of-function mutations displayed an extended survival relative to typical ALS cases. Taken together, these results broaden the phenotype spectrum resulting from mutations in KIF5A and strengthen the role of cytoskeletal defects in the pathogenesis of ALS.

AB Background: Methylation measures quantified by microarray techniques can be affected by systematic variation due to the technical processing of samples, which may compromise the accuracy of the measurement process and contribute to bias the estimate of the association under investigation. The quantification of the contribution of the systematic source of variation is challenging in datasets characterized by hundreds of thousands of features. In this study, we introduce a method previously developed for the analysis of metabolomics data to evaluate the performance of existing normalizing techniques to correct for unwanted variation. Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450K was used to acquire methylation levels in over 421,000 CpG sites for 902 study participants of a case-control study on breast cancer nested within the EPIC cohort. The principal component partial R-square (PC-PR2) analysis was used to identify and quantify the variability attributable to potential systematic sources of variation. Three correcting techniques, namely ComBat, surrogate variables analysis (SVA) and a linear regression model to compute residuals were applied. The impact of each correcting method on the association between smoking status and DNA methylation levels was evaluated, and results were compared with findings from a large meta-analysis.
   Results: A sizeable proportion of systematic variability due to variables expressing 'batch' and 'sample position' within 'chip' was identified, with values of the partial R-2 statistics equal to 9.5 and 11.4% of total variation, respectively. After application of ComBat or the residuals' methods, the contribution was 1.3 and 0.2%, respectively. The SVA technique resulted in a reduced variability due to 'batch' (1.3%) and 'sample position' (0.6%), and in a diminished variability attributable to 'chip' within a batch (0.9%). After ComBat or the residuals' corrections, a larger number of significant sites (k = 600 and k = 427, respectively) were associated to smoking status than the SVA correction (k = 96).
   Conclusions: The three correction methods removed systematic variation in DNA methylation data, as assessed by the PC-PR2, which lent itself as a useful tool to explore variability in large dimension data. SVA produced more conservative findings than ComBat in the association between smoking and DNA methylation.

AB Soil organic carbon (SOC) stored in northern peatlands and permafrost-affected soils are key components in the global carbon cycle. This article quantifies SOC stocks in a sub-Arctic mountainous peatland environment in the discontinuous permafrost zone in Abisko, northern Sweden. Four machine-learning techniques are evaluated for SOC quantification: multiple linear regression, artificial neural networks, support vector machine and random forest. The random forest model performed best and was used to predict SOC for several depth increments at a spatial resolution of 1 m (1 x 1 m). A high-resolution (1 m) land cover classification generated for this study is the most relevant predictive variable. The landscape mean SOC storage (0-150 cm) is estimated to be 8.3 +/- 8.0 kg C m(-2) and the SOC stored in the top meter (0-100 cm) to be 7.7 +/- 6.2 kg C m(-2). The predictive modeling highlights the relative importance of wetland areas and in particular peat plateaus for the landscape's SOC storage. The total SOC was also predicted at reduced spatial resolutions of 2, 10, 30, 100, 250 and 1000 m and shows a significant drop in land cover class detail and a tendency to underestimate the SOC at resolutions > 30 m. This is associated with the occurrence of many small-scale wetlands forming local hot-spots of SOC storage that are omitted at coarse resolutions. Sharp transitions in SOC storage associated with land cover and permafrost distribution are the most challenging methodological aspect. However, in this study, at local, regional and circum-Arctic scales, the main factor limiting robust SOC mapping efforts is the scarcity of soil pedon data from across the entire environmental space. For the Abisko region, past SOC and permafrost dynamics indicate that most of the SOC is barely 2000 years old and very dynamic. Future research needs to investigate the geomorphic response of permafrost degradation and the fate of SOC across all landscape compartments in post-permafrost landscapes.

AB Nonlinear light-matter interactions in the extreme ultraviolet (XUV) are a prerequisite to perform XUV-pump/XUV-probe spectroscopy of core electrons. Such interactions are now routinely investigated at free-electron laser (FEL) facilities. Yet, electron dynamics are often too fast to be captured with the femtosecond resolution of state-of-the-art FELs. Attosecond pulses from laser-driven XUV-sources offer the necessary temporal resolution. However, intense attosecond pulses supporting nonlinear processes have only been available for photon energy below 50 eV, precluding XUV-pump/XUV-probe investigation of typical inner-shell processes. Here, we surpass this limitation by demonstrating two-photon absorption from inner electronic shells of xenon at photon energies around 93 eV and 115 eV. This advance opens the door for attosecond real-time observation of nonlinear electron dynamics deep inside atoms.

AB Enzymatic substrate selectivity is critical for the precise control of metabolic pathways. In cases where chemically related substrates are present inside cells, robust mechanisms of substrate selectivity are required. Here, we report the mechanism utilized for catalytic ATP versus GTP selectivity during adenylate kinase (Adk) -mediated phosphorylation of AMP. Using NMR spectroscopy we found that while Adk adopts a catalytically competent and closed structural state in complex with ATP, the enzyme is arrested in a catalytically inhibited and open state in complex with GTP. X-ray crystallography experiments revealed that the interaction interfaces supporting ATP and GTP recognition, in part, are mediated by coinciding residues. The mechanism provides an atomic view on how the cellular GTP pool is protected from Adk turnover, which is important because GTP has many specialized cellular functions. In further support of this mechanism, a structure-function analysis enabled by synthesis of ATP analogs suggests that a hydrogen bond between the adenine moiety and the backbone of the enzyme is vital for ATP selectivity. The importance of the hydrogen bond for substrate selectivity is likely general given the conservation of its location and orientation across the family of eukaryotic protein kinases.

AB Background: Previous research suggests that the social network may play very different roles in relation to health in countries with differing welfare regimes.
   Objective: The study aimed to assess the interplay between social network, socioeconomic position, and self-rated health (SRH) in European countries.
   Methods: The study used cross-sectional data on individuals aged 50+ from the fourth wave of the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) and includes data from 16 countries. The outcome is poor SRH. All analyses are adjusted for age and stratified by gender.
   Results: Low satisfaction with the social network was associated with poor SRH among women in all country groups, but predicted poor SRH among males in West/Central and Eastern Europe only. The results from the multivariable analysis showed an increased likelihood of poor SRH among those with relatively lower education, as well as among those with low satisfaction with the social network (women from all country groups and men from Western/Central and Eastern Europe). However, the results from interaction analysis show that poor SRH for those with lower relative position in educational level was greater among those with higher satisfaction with the social network among male and female participants from Northern Europe. The health of individuals who are highly satisfied with their social network is more associated with socioeconomic status in Northern Europe.
   Conclusions: This study highlights the significance of social network and socioeconomic gradients in health among the elderly in Europe.

AB Streams are important sources of carbon to the atmosphere, though knowing whether they merely outgas terrestrially derived carbon dioxide or mineralize terrestrial inputs of dissolved organic matter (DOM) is still a big challenge in ecology. The objective of this study was to investigate the influence of riparian groundwater (GW) and instream processes on the temporal pattern of stream DOM concentrations and quality in a forested headwater stream, and whether this influence differed between the leaf litter fall (LLF) period and the remaining part of the year (non-LLF). The spectroscopic indexes (fluorescence index, biological index, humification index, and parallel factor analysis components) indicated that DOM had an eminently protein-like character and was most likely originated from microbial sources and recent biological activity in both stream water and riparian GW. However, paired samples of stream water and riparian GW showed that dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and nitrogen (DON) concentrations as well as the spectroscopic character of DOM differed between the two compartments throughout the year. A simple mass balance approach indicated that in-stream processes along the reach contributed to reducing DOC and DON fluxes by 50 and 30 %, respectively. Further, in-stream DOC and DON uptakes were unrelated to each other, suggesting that these two compounds underwent different biogeochemical pathways. During the LLF period, stream DOC and DOC: DON ratios were higher than during the non-LLF period, and spectroscopic indexes suggested a major influence of terrestrial vegetation on stream DOM. Our study highlights that stream DOM is not merely a reflection of riparian GW entering the stream and that headwater streams have the capacity to internally produce, transform, and consume DOM.

AB Nitrous oxide (N2O) is a powerful greenhouse gas and the main driver of stratospheric ozone depletion. Since soils are the largest source of N2O, predicting soil response to changes in climate or land use is central to understanding and managing N2O. Here we find that N2O flux can be predicted by models incorporating soil nitrate concentration (NO3-), water content and temperature using a global field survey of N2O emissions and potential driving factors across a wide range of organic soils. N2O emissions increase with NO3- and follow a bell-shaped distribution with water content. Combining the two functions explains 72% of N2O emission from all organic soils. Above 5 mg NO3--N kg(-1), either draining wet soils or irrigating well-drained soils increases N2O emission by orders of magnitude. As soil temperature together with NO3- explains 69% of N2O emission, tropical wetlands should be a priority for N2O management.

AB Type III secretion systems harbored by several Gram-negative bacteria are often used to deliver host-modulating effectors into infected eukaryotic cells. About 20 core proteins are needed for assembly of a secretion apparatus. Several of these proteins are genetically and functionally conserved in type III secretion systems of bacteria associated with invertebrate or vertebrate hosts. In the Ysc family of type III secretion systems are two poorly characterized protein families, the YscX family and the YscY family. In the plasmid-encoded Ysc-Yop type III secretion system of human pathogenic Yersinia species, YscX is a secreted substrate while YscY is its non-secreted cognate chaperone. Critically, neither an yscX nor yscY null mutant of Yersinia is capable of type III secretion. In this study, we show that the genetic equivalents of these proteins produced as components of other type III secretion systems of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PscX and PscY), Aeromonas species (AscX and AscY), Vibrio species (VscX and VscY), and Photorhabdus luminescens (SctX and SctY) all possess an ability to interact with its native cognate partner and also establish cross-reciprocal binding to non-cognate partners as judged by a yeast two-hybrid assay. Moreover, a yeast three-hybrid assay also revealed that these heterodimeric complexes could maintain an interaction with YscV family members, a core membrane component of all type III secretion systems. Despite maintaining these molecular interactions, only expression of the native yscX in the near full-length yscX deletion and native yscY in the near full-length yscY deletion were able to complement for their general substrate secretion defects. Hence, YscX and YscY must have co-evolved to confer an important function specifically critical for Yersinia type III secretion.

DT Article

AB Observational studies indicate that low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol acts as a primary contributor to an active process leading to aortic stenosis (AS) development. However, randomized clinical trials have failed to demonstrate an effect of lipid lowering on impeding AS progression. This study explored if pretreatment LDL levels and AS severity altered the efficacy of lipid-lowering therapy. The study goal was evaluated in the analysis of surviving patients with baseline data in the Simvastatin and Ezetimibe in Aortic Stenosis (SEAS) trial of 1,873 asymptomatic patients with mild-to-moderate AS. Serially measured peak aortic jet velocity was the primary effect estimate. Linear mixed model analysis adjusted by baseline peak jet velocity and pretreatment LDL levels was used to assess effect modifications of treatment. Data were available in 1,579 (84%) patients. In adjusted analyses, lower baseline peak aortic jet velocity and higher pretreatment LDL levels increased the effect of randomized treatment (p >= 0.04 for interaction). As such, treatment impeded progression of AS in the highest quartile of LDL among patients with mild AS at baseline (0.06 m/s per year slower progression vs placebo in peak aortic jet velocity, 95% confidence interval 0.01 to 0.11, p = 0.03), but not in the 3 other quartiles of LDL. Conversely, among patients with moderate AS, there was no detectable effect of treatment in any of the pretreatment LDL quartiles (all p In conclusion, in a non prespecified post hoc analysis, the efficacy of lipid-lowering therapy on impeding AS progression increased with higher pretreatment LDL and lower peak aortic jet velocity (SEAS study: NCT00092677).

AB Background: An inverse relationship between allergies with glioma risk has been reported in several but not all epidemiological observational studies. We performed an analysis of genetic variants associated with atopy to assess the relationship with glioma risk using Mendelian randomisation (MR), an approach unaffected by biases from temporal variability and reverse causation that might have affected earlier investigations.
   Methods: Two-sample MR was undertaken using genome-wide association study data. We used single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with atopic dermatitis, asthma and hay fever, IgE levels, and self-reported allergy as instrumental variables. We calculated MR estimates for the odds ratio (OR) for each risk factor with glioma using SNP-glioma estimates from 12,488 cases and 18,169 controls, using inverse-variance weighting (IVW), maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), weighted median estimate (WME) and mode-based estimate (MBE) methods. Violation of MR assumptions due to directional pleiotropy were sought using MR-Egger regression and HEIDI-outlier analysis.
   Results: Under IVW, MLE, WME and MBE methods, associations between glioma risk with asthma and hay fever, self-reported allergy and IgE levels were non-significant. An inverse relationship between atopic dermatitis and glioma risk was found by IVW (OR 0.96, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.93-1.00, P = 0.041) and MLE (OR 0.96, 95% CI 0.94-0.99, P = 0.003), but not by WME (OR 0.96, 95% CI 0.91-1.01, P = 0.114) or MBE (OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.92-1.02, P = 0.194).
   Conclusions: Our investigation does not provide strong evidence for relationship between atopy and the risk of developing glioma, but findings do not preclude a small effect in relation to atopic dermatitis. Our analysis also serves to illustrate the value of using several MR methods to derive robust conclusions.

TI Cell-type- and region-specific restriction of neurotropic flavivirus
   infection by viperin

AB Background: Flaviviruses are a group of diverse and emerging arboviruses and an immense global health problem. A number of flaviviruses are neurotropic, causing severe encephalitis and even death. Type I interferons (IFNs) are the first line of defense of the innate immune system against flavivirus infection. IFNs elicit the concerted action of numerous interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) to restrict both virus infection and replication. Viperin (virus-inhibitory protein, endoplasmic reticulum-associated, IFN-inducible) is an ISG with broad-spectrum antiviral activity against multiple flaviviruses in vitro. Its activity in vivo restricts neurotropic infections to specific regions of the central nervous system (CNS). However, the cell types in which viperin activity is required are unknown. Here we have examined both the regional and cell-type specificity of viperin in the defense against infection by several model neurotropic flaviviruses.
   Methods: Viral burden and IFN induction were analyzed in vivo in wild-type and viperin(-/-) mice infected with Langat virus (LGTV). The effects of IFN pretreatment were tested in vitro in primary neural cultures from different brain regions in response to infection with tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), West Nile virus (WNV), and Zika virus (ZIKV).
   Results: Viperin activity restricted nonlethal LGTV infection in the spleen and the olfactory bulb following infection via a peripheral route. Viperin activity was also necessary to restrict LGTV replication in the olfactory bulb and the cerebrum following CNS infection, but not in the cerebellum. In vitro, viperin could restrict TBEV replication in primary cortical neurons, but not in the cerebellar granule cell neurons. Interferon-induced viperin was also very important in primary cortical neurons to control TBEV, WNV, and ZIKV.
   Conclusions: Our findings show that viperin restricts replication of neurotropic flaviviruses in the CNS in a region- and cell-type-specific manner. The most important sites of activity are the olfactory bulb and cerebrum. Activity within the cerebrum is required in the cortical neurons in order to restrict spread. This study exemplifies cell type and regional diversity of the IFN response within the CNS and shows the importance of a potent broad-spectrum antiviral ISG.

AB Given the speed of air travel, diseases even with a short viremia such as dengue can be easily exported to dengue naive areas within 24 hours. We set out to estimate the risk of dengue virus introductions via travelers into Europe and number of secondary autochthonous cases as a result of the introduction. We applied mathematical modeling to estimate the number of dengue-viremic air passengers from 16 dengue-endemic countries to 27 European countries, taking into account the incidence of dengue in the exporting countries, travel volume and the probability of being viremic at the time of travel. Our models estimate a range from zero to 167 air passengers who are dengue-viremic at the time of travel from dengue endemic countries to each of the 27 receiving countries in one year. Germany receives the highest number of imported dengue-viremic air passengers followed by France and the United Kingdom. Our findings estimate 10 autochthonous secondary asymptomatic and symptomatic dengue infections, caused by the expected 124 infected travelers who arrived in Italy in 2012. The risk of onward transmission in Europe is reassuringly low, except where Aedes aegypti is present.

AB We evaluated the long-term implications from modifying rotation lengths in production forests for four forest-reliant species with different habitat requirements. By combining simulations of forest development with habitat models, and accounting both for stand and landscape scale influences, we projected habitat availability over 150 years in a large Swedish landscape, using rotation lengths which are longer (+22% and +50%) and shorter (-22%) compared to current practices. In terms of mean habitat availability through time, species requiring older forest were affected positively by extended rotations, and negatively by shortened rotations. For example, the mean habitat area for the treecreeper Certhia familiaris (a bird preferring forest with larger trees) increased by 31% when rotations were increased by 22%, at a 5% cost to net present value (NPV) and a 7% decrease in harvested volume. Extending rotation lengths by 50% provided more habitat for this species compared to a 22% extension, but at a much higher marginal cost. In contrast, the beetle Hadreule elongatula, which is dependent on sun-exposed dead wood, benefited from shortened rather than prolonged rotations. Due to an uneven distribution of stand-ages within the landscape, the relative amounts of habitat provided by different rotation length scenarios for a given species were not always consistent through time during the simulation period. If implemented as a conservation measure, prolonging rotations will require long-term strategic planning to avoid future bottlenecks in habitat availability, and will need to be accompanied by complementary measures accounting for the diversity of habitats necessary for the conservation of forest biodiversity.

AB We present a new approach for adding Bernoulli beam reinforcements to Kirchhoff plates. The plate is discretised using a continuous/discontinuous finite element method based on standard continuous piecewise polynomial finite element spaces. The beams are discretised by the CutFEM technique of letting the basis functions of the plate represent also the beams which are allowed to pass through the plate elements. This allows for a fast and easy way of assessing where the plate should be supported, for instance, in an optimization loop.

AB Evidence from in vivo, in vitro and ecological studies are suggestive of a protective effect of vitamin D against pancreatic cancer (PC). However, this has not been confirmed by analytical epidemiological studies. We aimed to examine the association between pre-diagnostic circulating vitamin D concentrations and PC incidence in European populations. We conducted a pooled nested case-control study within the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) and the Nord-TrOndelag Health Study's second survey (HUNT2) cohorts. In total, 738 primary incident PC cases (EPIC n=626; HUNT2 n=112; median follow-up=6.9 years) were matched to 738 controls. Vitamin D [25(OH)D-2 and 25(OH)D-3 combined] concentrations were determined using isotope-dilution liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Conditional logistic regression models with adjustments for body mass index and smoking habits were used to estimate incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI). Compared with a reference category of >50 to 75 nmol/L vitamin D, the IRRs (95% CIs) were 0.71 (0.42-1.20); 0.94 (0.72-1.22); 1.12 (0.82-1.53) and 1.26 (0.79-2.01) for clinically pre-defined categories of 25; >25 to 50; >75 to 100; and >100 nmol/L vitamin D, respectively (p for trend=0.09). Corresponding analyses by quintiles of season-standardized vitamin D concentrations also did not reveal associations with PC risk (p for trend=0.23). Although these findings among participants from the largest combination of European cohort studies to date show increasing effect estimates of PC risk with increasing pre-diagnostic concentrations of vitamin D, they are not statistically significant.

AB Much of life's diversity has arisen through ecological opportunity and adaptive radiations, but the mechanistic underpinning of such diversification is not fully understood. Competition and predation can affect adaptive radiations, but contrasting theoretical and empirical results show that they can both promote and interrupt diversification. A mechanistic understanding of the link between microevolutionary processes and macroevolutionary patterns is thus needed, especially in trophic communities. Here, we use a trait-based eco-evolutionary model to investigate the mechanisms linking competition, predation and adaptive radiations. By combining available micro-evolutionary theory and simulations of adaptive radiations we show that intraspecific competition is crucial for diversification as it induces disruptive selection, in particular in early phases of radiation. The diversification rate is however decreased in later phases owing to interspecific competition as niche availability, and population sizes are decreased. We provide new insight into how predation tends to have a negative effect on prey diversification through decreased population sizes, decreased disruptive selection and through the exclusion of prey from parts of niche space. The seemingly disparate effects of competition and predation on adaptive radiations, listed in the literature, may thus be acting and interacting in the same adaptive radiation at different relative strength as the radiation progresses.

AB Transection of the median nerve typically causes lifelong restriction of fine sensory and motor skills of the affected hand despite the best available surgical treatment. Inspired by recent findings on activity-dependent structural plasticity of the adult brain, we used voxel-based morphometry to analyze the brains of 16 right-handed adults who more than two years earlier had suffered injury to the left or right median nerve followed by microsurgical repair. Healthy individuals served as matched controls. Irrespective of side of injury, we observed gray matter reductions in left ventral and right dorsal premotor cortex, and white matter reductions in commissural pathways interconnecting those motor areas. Only left-side injured participants showed gray matter reduction in the hand area of the contralesional primary motor cortex. We interpret these effects as structural manifestations of reduced neural processing linked to restrictions in the diversity of the natural manual dexterity repertoire. Furthermore, irrespective of side of injury, we observed gray matter increases bilaterally in a motion-processing visual area. We interpret this finding as a consequence of increased neural processing linked to greater dependence on vision for control of manual dexterity after median nerve injury because of a compromised somatosensory innervation of the affected hand.

TI Zero-crossing statistics for non-Markovian time series
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW E
LA English
DT Article
AB In applications spanning from image analysis and speech recognition to energy dissipation in turbulence and time-to failure of fatigued materials, researchers and engineers want to calculate how often a stochastic observable crosses a specific level, such as zero. At first glance this problem looks simple, but it is in fact theoretically very challenging, and therefore few exact results exist. One exception is the celebrated Rice formula that gives the mean number of zero crossings in a fixed time interval of a zero-mean Gaussian stationary process. In this study we use the so-called independent interval approximation to go beyond Rice's result and derive analytic expressions for all higher-order zero-crossing cumulants and moments. Our results agree well with simulations for the non-Markovian autoregressive model.

AB Background: Autonomic neuropathy in diabetes, in addition to causing a range of symptoms originating from the autonomic nervous system, may increase cardiovascular morbidity. Our aim was to study the progression of autonomic neuropathy, based on symptom score and evaluation of an autonomic test, in persons with normal and impaired glucose tolerance and in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D).
   Methods: Participants were recruited in 2003/2004 with a follow-up in 2014. The participants' glucose tolerance was categorized using oral glucose tolerance tests. Symptoms were evaluated using an autonomic symptom score (ASS), ECG was used to test cardiac autonomic function based on the expiration/inspiration ratio (E/I ratio), and blood samples were taken on both occasions.
   Results: ASSs were higher at follow-up in the T2D patients than in the normal glucose tolerance group (mean 1.21 +/- 1.30 vs. 0.79 +/- 0.7; p < 0.05). E/I ratio did not deteriorate more than could be expected as an aging effect in well-controlled T2D. No relationship was found between E/I ratio and HbA1c or ASS.
   Conclusion: The presence of autonomic symptoms increased over time in T2D patients, but the symptoms did not correlate with the Ell ratio in this metabolically well-controlled cohort. ASSs can be a useful clinical tool when assessing the progression of autonomic dysfunction in patients with abnormal glucose metabolism.

AB Serine metabolism in plants has been studied mostly in relation to photorespiration where serine is formed from two molecules of glycine. However, two other pathways of serine formation operate in plants and represent the branches of glycolysis diverging at the level of 3-phosphoglyceric acid. One branch (the glycerate serine pathway) is initiated in the cytosol and involves glycerate formation from 3phosphoglycerate, while the other (the phosphorylated serine pathway) operates in plastids and forms phosphohydroxypyruvate as an intermediate. Serine formed in these pathways becomes a precursor of glycine, formate and glycolate accumulating in stress conditions. The pathways can be linked to GABA shunt via transamination reactions and via participation of the same reductase for both glyoxylate and succinic semialdehyde. In this review paper we present a hypothesis of the regulation of redox balance in stressed plant cells via participation of the reactions associated with glycerate and phosphorylated serine pathways. We consider these pathways as important processes linking carbon and nitrogen metabolism and maintaining cellular redox and energy levels in stress conditions.

AB Thickening of tree stems is the result of secondary growth, accomplished by the meristematic activity of the vascular cambium. Secondary growth of the stem entails developmental cascades resulting in the formation of secondary phloem outwards and secondary xylem (i.e., wood) inwards of the stem. Signaling and transcriptional reprogramming by the phytohormone ethylene modifies cambial growth and cell differentiation, but the molecular link between ethylene and secondary growth remains unknown. We addressed this shortcoming by analyzing expression profiles and co-expression networks of ethylene pathway genes using the AspWood transcriptome database which covers all stages of secondary growth in aspen (Populus tremula) stems. ACC synthase expression suggests that the ethylene precursor 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) is synthesized during xylem expansion and xylem cell maturation. Ethylene-mediated transcriptional reprogramming occurs during all stages of secondary growth, as deduced from AspWood expression profiles of ethylene-responsive genes. A network centrality analysis of the AspWood dataset identified EIN3D and 11 ERFs as hubs. No overlap was found between the co-expressed genes of the EIN3 and ERF hubs, suggesting target diversification and hence independent roles for these transcription factor families during normal wood formation. The EIN3D hub was part of a large co-expression gene module, which contained 16 transcription factors, among them several new candidates that have not been earlier connected to wood formation and a VND-INTERACTING 2 (VNI2) homolog. We experimentally demonstrated Populus EIN3D function in ethylene signaling in Arabidopsis thaliana. The ERF hubs ERF118 and ERF119 were connected on the basis of their expression pattern and gene co-expression module composition to xylem cell expansion and secondary cell wall formation, respectively. We hereby establish data resources for ethylene-responsive genes and potential targets for EIN3D and ERF transcription factors in Populus stem tissues, which can help to understand the range of ethylene targeted biological processes during secondary growth.

   NUMBERS; FACTS
AB Introduction
   Amongst patients with incurable cancer approaching death, cachexia is common and associated with adverse outcomes. The term cachexia lacks a universally accepted definition and there is no consensus regarding which variables are to be measured. Furthermore, an elevated C-reactive protein is a common clinical challenge in this patient group. This study aims to add to the ongoing discussion regarding the definition of cancer cachexia and to study the role of C-reactive protein and s-albumin in this context.
   Material and methods
   A 1-year cohort, consisting of 155 cancer patients enrolled in a specialized palliative home care team in the city of Ostersund, Sweden, that were deceased during the year of 2015 was studied. Laboratory measures were studied within 0-30 and 31-60 days prior to death. C-reactive protein >10 mg/L and coinciding s-albumin <30 g/L was referred to as "laboratory cachexia". Also, the number of days from the first found "laboratory cachexia" until death was noted.
   Results
   The prevalence of "laboratory cachexia" was 85% 0-30 days prior to death compared to 66% 31-60 days prior to death (p<0.01). The majority of patients (75%) had an onset of "laboratory cachexia" within 0-120 days prior to death, with a median of 47 days. The median values for C-reactive protein and s-albumin within 0-30 days prior to death were 84mg/L and 23g/L respectively.
   Discussion
   Could markedly deranged values of C-reactive protein and s-albumin, such as found in this study, signal a relatively short remaining survival time in patients with incurable cancer and no clinical signs of ongoing infection? The role of "laboratory cachexia" in this context as well as the cut off values for the laboratory measures included may be further discussed.

AB Humic substances (HSs) have considerable effects on soil fertility and crop productivity owing to their unique physiochemical and biochemical properties, and play a vital role in establishing biotic and abiotic interactions within the plant rhizosphere. A comprehensive understanding of the mode of action and tissue distribution of HS is, however, required, as this knowledge could be useful for devising advanced rhizospheric management practices. These substances trigger various molecular processes in plant cells, and can strengthen the plant's tolerance to various kinds of abiotic stresses. HS manifest their effects in cells through genetic, post-transcriptional, and post-translational modifications of signaling entities that trigger different molecular, biochemical, and physiological processes. Understanding of such fundamental mechanisms will provide a better perspective for defining the cues and signaling crosstalk of HS that mediate various metabolic and hormonal networks operating in plant systems. Various regulatory activities and distribution strategies of HS have been discussed in this review.

AB A complex mixture of electromagnetic fields is used in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): static, low-frequency, and radio frequency magnetic fields. Commonly, the static magnetic field ranges from one to three Tesla. The low-frequency field can reach several millitesla and with a time derivative of the order of some Tesla per second. The radiofrequency (RF) field has a magnitude in the microtesla range giving rise to specific absorption rate values of a few Watts per kilogram. Very little attention has been paid to the case where there is a combined exposure to several different fields at the same time. Some studies have shown genotoxic effects in cells after exposure to an MRI scan while others have not demonstrated any effects. A typical MRI exam includes muliple imaging sequences of varying length and intensity, to produce different types of images. Each sequence is designed with a particular purpose in mind, so one sequence can, for example, be optimized for clearly showing fat water contrast, while another is optimized for high-resolution detail. It is of the utmost importance that future experimental studies give a thorough description of the exposure they are using, and not just a statement such as "An ordinary MRI sequence was used." Even if the sequence is specified, it can differ substantially between manufacturers on, e.g., RF pulse height, width, and duty cycle. In the latest SCENIHR opinion, it is stated that there is very little information regarding the health effects of occupational exposure to MRI fields, and long-term prospective or retrospective cohort studies on workers are recommended as a high priority. They also state that MRI is increasingly used in pediatric diagnostic imaging, and a cohort study into the effects of MRI exposure on children is recommended as a high priority. For the exposure assessment in epidemiological studies, there is a clear difference between patients and staff and further work is needed on this. Studies that explore the possible differences between MRI scan sequences and compare them in terms of exposure level are warranted.

AB The decline in petrochemical wax supply coupled with the ever-growing demand for bio-products means that the development of a sustainable process to renewably sourced waxes is paramount. This review focuses on recent advances in supercritical extraction as a clean efficient process for extracting waxes from waste biomass as a part of a holistic biorefinery. The use of supercritical carbon dioxide leads to reductions in solvent waste and leaves no solvent residues meaning that the biomass can further processed without the need for energy-intensive solvent removal steps. This technology crucially improves the downstream conversion of residual cellulosic biomass for the sustainable production of sugars, consumer products and biofuels (up to a 40% increase in ethanol production) leading to higher energy efficiencies and higher economic returns. Supercritical carbon dioxide extraction is not only an important technology for the cleaner production of waxes, it is a sustainable pre-treatment of biomass as part of an integrated holistic biorefinery and significantly, it can improve the safety of products, e.g. less off gassing of wood pellets.

AB In bacteria and archaea, clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) and CRISPR-associated (Cas) proteins constitute an adaptive immune system against phages and other foreign genetic elements. Here, we review the biology of the diverse CRISPR-Cas systems and the major progress achieved in recent years in understanding the underlying mechanisms of the three stages of CRISPR-Cas immunity: adaptation, crRNA biogenesis, and interference. The ecology and regulation of CRISPR-Cas in the context of phage infection, the roles of these systems beyond immunity, and the open questions that propel the field forward are also discussed.

AB Three compounds consisting of the electron-donating triphenylamine-phenothiazine conjugate backbone and each of the electron-withdrawing groups 3-ethylrhodanine, malononitrile and 1,3-indandione have been synthesized and used as donors in blends with [6,6]-phenyl-C70-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) for organic solar cell devices. After improvements of the active layer structure by a selected donor-to-acceptor weight ratio and a two-step solvent and thermal annealing, the organic solar cells showed power conversion efficiency (PCE) values in the range of 4.79-7.25%. The highest PCE was obtained for the bulk heterojunction device with the indandione compound, which can be attributed to its better absorption profile, higher crystallinity, more balanced electron and hole transport, higher charge collection efficiency and reduced recombination, in comparison with the photovoltaic cells from the other two compounds. DFT-calculated characteristics, absorption spectra and cyclic voltammetry of the compounds, along with X-ray diffraction patterns of the blend films, are used to validate the photovoltaic results.

AB Reliable information on the decomposition of polysaccharides is important to evaluate the evolution and properties of hydrothermally carbonized chars. Hyperspectral imaging offers a quick and robust alternative to expensive and time-consuming laboratory methods to determine the polysaccharide contents of biomass and biomass-derived chars. Here, we show that the decomposition of hemicellulose and cellulose were visible in the acquired hyperspectral images even without image calibration. Image regression based on sample holocellulose, glucan and the sum of xylan, galactan, arabinan and mannan provided good calibration models and enabled visualizing the decomposition of polysaccharides based on carbonization temperature. Hyperspectral imaging thus provides a non-destructive alternative to traditional polysaccharide analyses of hydrochars for laboratory and potential future industrial applications.

AB Background: Differences in stroke care and health outcomes between men and women are debated. The objective of this study was to explore the relationship between patients' sex and post-stroke health outcomes and received care in a Swedish setting.
   Methods: Patients with a registered diagnosis of acute intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) or ischemic stroke (IS) within regional administrative systems (ICD-10 codes I61* or I63*) and the Swedish Stroke Register during 2010-2011 were included and followed for 1 year. Data linkage to multiple other data sources on individual level was performed. Adjustments were performed for age, socioeconomic factors, living arrangements, ADL dependency, and stroke severity in multivariate regression analyses of health outcomes and received care. Health outcomes (e.g., survival, functioning, satisfaction) and received care measures (regional and municipal resources and processes) were studied.
   Results: Study population: 13,775 women and 13,916 men. After case-mix adjustments for the above factors, we found women to have higher 1-year survival rates after both IS (ORfemale = 1.17, p < 0.001) and ICH (ORfemale = 1.65, p < 0.001). Initial inpatient stay at hospital was, however, shorter for women (beta(female, IS) = -0.05, p < 0.001; beta(female, ICH) = -0.08, p < 0.005). For IS, good function (mRS <= 2) was more common in men (ORfemale = 0.86, p < 0.001) who also received more inpatient care during the first year (beta(female) = -0.05, p < 0.001).
   Conclusions: A lower proportion of women had good functioning, a difference that remained in IS after adjustments for age, socioeconomic factors, living arrangements, ADL dependency, and stroke severity. The amount of received hospital care was lower for women after adjustments. Whether shorter hospital stay results in lower function or is a consequence of lower function cannot be elucidated. One-year survival was higher in men when no adjustments were made but lower after adjustments. This likely reflects that women were older at time of stroke, had more severe strokes, and more disability pre-stroke-factors that make a direct comparison between the sexes intricate.

AB Although a minority of asthma patients suffer from severe asthma, they represent a major clinical challenge in terms of poor symptom control despite high-dose treatment, risk of exacerbations, and side effects. Novel biological treatments may benefit patients with severe asthma, but are expensive, and are only effective in appropriately targeted patients. In some patients, symptoms are driven by other factors than asthma, and all patients with suspected severe asthma ('difficult asthma') should undergo systematic assessment, in order to differentiate between true severe asthma, and 'difficult-to-treat' patients, in whom poor control is related to factors such as poor adherence or co-morbidities. The Nordic Consensus Statement on severe asthma was developed by the Nordic Severe Asthma Network, consisting of members from Norway, Sweden, Finland, Denmark, Iceland and Estonia, including representatives from the respective national respiratory scientific societies with the aim to provide an overview and recommendations regarding the diagnosis, systematic assessment and management of severe asthma. Furthermore, the Consensus Statement proposes recommendations for the organization of severe asthma management in primary, secondary, and tertiary care.

AB Peptidoglycan-associated lipoprotein (PAL) is a conserved pro-inflammatory outer membrane lipoprotein in Gram-negative bacteria. Compared to systemic pathogens, little is known about the virulence properties of PAL in Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (AaPAL). The aims of this study were to investigate the cytolethality of AaPAL and its ability to induce pro-inflammatory cytokine production in macrophages. Mouse macrophages were stimulated with AaPAL, and the production of IL-1 beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha, and MCP-1 was measured after 6, 24, and 48 h. To investigate which receptor AaPAL employs for its interaction with macrophages, anti-toll-like receptor (TLR)2 and anti-TLR4 antibodies were used to block respective TLRs on macrophages. Metabolic activity and apoptosis of the macrophages were investigated after stimulation with AaPAL. AaPAL induced the production of MCP-1, TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IL-1 beta from mouse macrophages in order of decreasing abundance. The pre-treatment of macrophages with an anti-TLR2 antibody significantly diminished cytokine production. Under AaPAL stimulation, the metabolic activity of macrophages decreased in a dose-and time-dependent manner. Furthermore, AaPAL induced apoptosis in 56% of macrophages after 48 h of incubation. Our data suggest that AaPAL can kill macrophages by apoptosis. The results also emphasize the role of AaPAL as a potent pro-inflammatory agent in A. actinomycetemcomitans-associated infections.

AB Species richness is regulated by a complex network of scale-dependent processes. This complexity can obscure the influence of limiting species interactions, making it difficult to determine if abiotic or biotic drivers are more predominant regulators of richness. Using integrative modeling of freshwater fish richness from 721 lakes along an 11 degrees latitudinal gradient, we find negative interactions to be a relatively minor independent predictor of species richness in lakes despite the widespread presence of predators. Instead, interaction effects, when detectable among major functional groups and 231 species pairs, were strong, often positive, but contextually dependent on environment. These results are consistent with the idea that negative interactions internally structure lake communities but do not consistently 'scale-up' to regulate richness independently of the environment. The importance of environment for interaction outcomes and its role in the regulation of species richness highlights the potential sensitivity of fish communities to the environmental changes affecting lakes globally.

AB Autophagy is a major catabolic process whereby autophagosomes deliver cytoplasmic content to the lytic compartment for recycling. Autophagosome formation requires two ubiquitin-like systems conjugating Atg12 with Atg5, and Atg8 with lipid phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), respectively. Genetic suppression of these systems causes autophagy-deficient phenotypes with reduced fitness and longevity. We show that Atg5 and the E1-like enzyme, Atg7, are rate-limiting components of Atg8-PE conjugation in Arabidopsis. Overexpression of ATG5 or ATG7 stimulates Atg8 lipidation, autophagosome formation, and autophagic flux. It also induces transcriptional changes opposite to those observed in atg5 and atg7 mutants, favoring stress resistance and growth. As a result, ATG5-or ATG7-over-expressing plants exhibit increased resistance to necrotrophic pathogens and oxidative stress, delayed aging and enhanced growth, seed set, and seed oil content. This work provides an experimental paradigm and mechanistic insight into genetic stimulation of autophagy in planta and shows its efficiency for improving plant productivity.

ID MINIMAL RESIDUAL DISEASE; LESSONS
AB Background: Few biological markers are associated with survival after relapse of B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL). In pediatric T-cell ALL, we have identified promoter-associated methylation alterations that correlate with prognosis. Here, the prognostic relevance of CpG island methylation phenotype (CIMP) classification was investigated in pediatric BCP-ALL patients.
   Methods: Six hundred and one BCP-ALL samples from Nordic pediatric patients (age 1-18) were CIMP classified at initial diagnosis and analyzed in relation to clinical data.
   Results: Among the 137 patients that later relapsed, patients with a CIMP-profile (n = 42) at initial diagnosis had an inferior overall survival (pOS(5years) 33%) compared to CIMP+ patients (n = 95, pOS(5years) 65%) (p = 0.001), which remained significant in a Cox proportional hazards model including previously defined risk factors.
   Conclusion: CIMP classification is a strong candidate for improved risk stratification of relapsed BCP-ALL.

TI Impacts of droughts and extreme-temperature events on gross primary
   production and ecosystem respiration: a systematic assessment across
   ecosystems and climate zones

AB Extreme climatic events, such as droughts and heat stress, induce anomalies in ecosystem-atmosphere CO2 fluxes, such as gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (R-eco), and, hence, can change the net ecosystem carbon balance. However, despite our increasing understanding of the underlying mechanisms, the magnitudes of the impacts of different types of extremes on GPP and Reco within and between ecosystems remain poorly predicted.
   Here we aim to identify the major factors controlling the amplitude of extreme-event impacts on GPP, Reco, and the resulting net ecosystem production (NEP). We focus on the impacts of heat and drought and their combination. We identified hydrometeorological extreme events in consistently downscaled water availability and temperature measurements over a 30-year time period. We then used FLUXNET eddy covariance flux measurements to estimate the CO2 flux anomalies during these extreme events across dominant vegetation types and climate zones.
   Overall, our results indicate that short-term heat extremes increased respiration more strongly than they downregulated GPP, resulting in a moderate reduction in the ecosystem's carbon sink potential. In the absence of heat stress, droughts tended to have smaller and similarly dampening effects on both GPP and Reco and, hence, often resulted in neutral NEP responses. The combination of drought and heat typically led to a strong decrease in GPP, whereas heat and drought impacts on respiration partially offset each other. Taken together, compound heat and drought events led to the strongest C sink reduction compared to any single-factor extreme. A key insight of this paper, however, is that duration matters most: for heat stress during droughts, the magnitude of impacts systematically increased with duration, whereas under heat stress without drought, the response of Reco over time turned from an initial increase to a downregulation after about 2 weeks. This confirms earlier theories that not only the magnitude but also the duration of an extreme event determines its impact.
   Our study corroborates the results of several local site-level case studies but as a novelty generalizes these findings on the global scale. Specifically, we find that the different response functions of the two antipodal land-atmosphere fluxes GPP and Reco can also result in increasing NEP during certain extreme conditions. Apparently counterintuitive findings of this kind bear great potential for scrutinizing the mechanisms implemented in state-of-the-art terrestrial biosphere models and provide a benchmark for future model development and testing.

AB Background: Despite various guidelines, shortcomings in lifestyle counseling in primary care have been demonstrated. Comparisons between countries may provide insight on how to improve such counseling. To the best of our knowledge, studies comparing patients' views of lifestyle counseling beween the United States (US) and European countries have not been reported.
   Objectives: To quantify and compare patients' perspectives in the US and Sweden on primary care providers' counseling on weight, eating habits, physical activity, smoking, and alcohol consumption.
   Methods: In a cross-sectional study, 629 patients from Sweden and the US completed a telephone interview about their experiences after a visit to a physician in primary care. The survey focused on patients' perception of the importance of healthy lifestyle habits, their need to change, their desire to receive support from primary care, and the support they had actually received. Data were analyzed using chi-square or Fisher's exact test.
   Results: For three of the four lifestyle habits, the proportion saying they needed to change was higher in the US. The exception was for alcohol, where Swedish subjects indicated a greater need to change. Among those stating a need to change, the proportion saying that they would like to have support from primary care was generally above 80% in both countries. The proportion of US patients reporting that their primary care provider had initiated a discussion of lifestyle modification was, with the exception of alcohol, roughly double the level reported by the Swedish patients.
   Conclusions: This study demonstrates high and quite similar patient expectations concerning lifestyle counseling in both countries, but more frequent initiation of discussions of most lifestyle issues in US primary care. Further studies, e.g. qualitative interviews with physicians, and medical record reviews, are required to better understand what can explain the differences between countries indicated by the study.

AB The terminal differentiation and elimination of the embryo-suspensor is the earliest manifestation of programmed cell death (PCD) during plant ontogenesis. Molecular regulation of suspensor PCD remains poorly understood. Norway spruce (Picea abies) embryos provide a powerful model for studying embryo development because of their large size, sequenced genome, and the possibility to obtain a large number of embryos at a specific developmental stage through somatic embryogenesis. Here, we have carried out global gene expression analysis of the Norway spruce embryo-suspensor versus embryonal mass (a gymnosperm analogue of embryo proper) using RNA sequencing. We have identified that suspensors have enhanced expression of the NAC domain-containing transcription factors, XND1 and ANAC075, previously shown to be involved in the initiation of developmental PCD in Arabidiopsis. The analysis has also revealed enhanced expression of Norway spruce homologues of the known executioners of both developmental and stress-induced cell deaths, such as metacaspase 9 (MC9), cysteine endopeptidase-1 (CEP1) and ribonuclease 3 (RNS3). Interestingly, a spruce homologue of bax inhibitor-1 (PaBI-1, for Picea abies BI-1), an evolutionarily conserved cell death suppressor, was likewise up-regulated in the embryosuspensor. Since Arabidopsis BI-1 so far has been implicated only in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-stress induced cell death, we investigated its role in embryogenesis and suspensor PCD using RNA interference (RNAi). We have found that PaBI-1-deficient lines formed a large number of abnormal embryos with suppressed suspensor elongation and disturbed polarity. Cytochemical staining of suspensor cells has revealed that PaBI-1 deficiency suppresses vacuolar cell death and induces necrotic type of cell death previously shown to compromise embryo development. This study demonstrates that a large number of cell-death components are conserved between angiosperms and gymnosperms and establishes a new role for BI-1 in the progression of vacuolar cell death.

AB The stringent response is a global reprogramming of bacterial physiology that renders cells more tolerant to antibiotics and induces virulence gene expression in pathogens in response to stress. This process is driven by accumulation of the intracellular alarmone guanosine-5'-di(tri)phosphate-3'-diphosphate ((p)ppGpp), which is produced by enzymes of the RelA SpoT homologue (RSH) family. The Gram-positive Firmicute pathogen, Staphylococcus aureus, encodes three RSH enzymes: a multidomain RSH (Rel) that senses amino acid starvation on the ribosome and two small alarmone synthetase (SAS) enzymes, RelQ (SAS1) and RelP (SAS2). In Bacillus subtilis, RelQ (SAS1) was shown to form a tetramer that is activated by pppGpp and inhibited by single-stranded RNA, but the structural and functional regulation of RelP (SAS2) is unexplored. Here, we present crystal structures of S. aureus RelP in two major functional states, pre-catalytic (bound to GTP and the non-hydrolyzable ATP analogue, adenosine 5'-(alpha,beta-methylene) triphosphate (AMP-CPP)), and post-catalytic (bound to pppGpp). We observed that RelP also forms a tetramer, but unlike RelQ (SAS1), it is strongly inhibited by both pppGpp and ppGpp and is insensitive to inhibition by RNA. We also identified putative metal ion-binding sites at the subunit interfaces that were consistent with the observed activation of the enzyme by Zn2+ ions. The structures reported here reveal the details of the catalytic mechanism of SAS enzymes and provide a molecular basis for understanding differential regulation of SAS enzymes in Firmicute bacteria.

AB Leucine-rich repeats and immunoglobulin-like domains 1 (LRIG1) is a tumor suppressor and a negative regulator of several receptor tyrosine kinases. The molecular mechanisms by which LRIG1 mediates its tumor suppressor effects and regulates receptor tyrosine kinases remain incompletely understood. Here, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen to identify novel LRIG1-interacting proteins and mined data from the Bio-Plex (biophysical interactions of ORFeome-based complexes) protein interaction data repository. The putative LRIG1 interactors identified in the screen were functionally evaluated using a triple co-transfection system in which HEK293 cells were co-transfected with platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha, LRIG1, and shRNAs against the identified LRIG1 interactors. The effects of the shRNAs on the ability of LRIG1 to down-regulate platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha expression were evaluated. On the basis of these results, we present an LRIG1 protein interaction network with many newly identified components. The network contains the apparently functionally important LRIG1-interacting proteins RAB4A, PON2, GAL3ST1, ZBTB16, LRIG2, CNPY3, HLA-DRA, GML, CNPY4, LRRC40, and LRIG3, together with GLRX3, PTPRK, and other proteins. In silico analyses of The Cancer Genome Atlas data sets revealed consistent correlations between the expression of the transcripts encoding LRIG1 and its interactors ZBTB16 and PTPRK and inverse correlations between the transcripts encoding LRIG1 and GLRX3. We further studied the LRIG1 function-promoting paraoxonase PON2 and found that it co-localized with LRIG1 in LRIG1-transfected cells. The proposed LRIG1 protein interaction network will provide leads for future studies aiming to understand the molecular functions of LRIG1 and the regulation of growth factor signaling.

AB Background: Heart failure is a disease with high morbidity, mortality, and physical and psychological burden. More knowledge about the care provided for patients with heart failure close to death is needed. Objective: The aim was to describe key aspects of palliative care during the last week of life in patients with heart failure, as reported by healthcare professionals. Design: This is a national register study. Setting/Subjects: The study included 3981 patients with diagnosed heart failure as the underlying cause of death. Measurements: Data were obtained from the Swedish Register of Palliative Care, a national quality register that focuses on patients' last week of life, independent of diagnosis or care setting. The register includes information about care interventions connected with key aspects of palliative care. Data are reported retrospectively by a nurse or physician at the healthcare unit where the patient dies. Results: Only 4.2% of patients with heart failure received specialized palliative care. In their last week of life, symptom prevalence was high, validated scales were seldom used, and symptoms were unsatisfactorily relieved. Around one-fifth (17%) of the patients in the study died alone. Less than half of family members had been offered bereavement support (45%). Moreover, one-third (28%) of the patients and more than half (61%) of the family members were reported to have had end-of-life discussions with a physician during the illness trajectory. Conclusion: The results indicate inadequate palliative care for patients with heart failure during their last week of life.

AB Introduction In the scientific literature, there is very limited empirical information on end-of-life issues after stroke in the scientific literature. The present nationwide study describes the circumstances surrounding deaths that occur within a year after a stroke.
   Patients and methods Datasets from three nationwide Swedish registers (on stroke, palliative care and cause of death) were linked. Basic information was available for 42,502 unselected cases of death that occurred within a year after a stroke and more detailed information was available for 16,408 deaths. Odds ratios for characteristics of end-of-life care were calculated by logistic regression.
   Results In the late phase after stroke (three months to one year), 46% of patients died in a nursing home, whereas 37% of patients died in a hospital after readmission and 10% of patients died at home. Eleven per cent of deaths were reported as being unexpected. A next of kin was present at 49% of deaths. The frequency of unattended deaths (neither next of kin nor staff were present at the time of death) ranged from 5% at home with specialised home care to 25% in hospitals.
   Discussion This is, by far, the largest study published on end-of-life issues after stroke. Major differences between countries in healthcare, community services, family structure and culture may limit direct transfer of the present results to other settings.
   Conclusion There is considerable discordance between presumed good death' late after stroke (dying at home surrounded by family members) and the actual circumstances at the end of life.

AB Key message Spatial analysis could improve the accuracy of genetic analyses, as well as increasing the accuracy of predicting breeding values and genetic gain for Norway spruce trials.
   Context Spatial analysis has been increasingly used in genetic evaluation of field trials in tree species. However, the efficiency of spatial analysis relative to the analysis using the conventional experimental designs or pre- and post-blocking method in Swedish genetic trials has not been systematically evaluated.
   Aims This study aims to examine the effectiveness of spatial analysis in improving the accuracy of predicting breeding values and genetic gain.
   Methods Spatial analysis, using separable first-order autoregressive processes of residuals in rows and columns, was used in nine types of trait classes from 145 field trials of Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) in Sweden.
   Results Ninety-six percent of variables (traits) were converged for the spatial model. Large trials with a large block variance tend to have a larger improvement from the model of experimental design to spatial model in accuracy. Growth and Pilodyn measurement traits showed greater improvements in log likelihood, accuracy, and genetic gain. Block variance was reduced by more than 80% for trait height and diameter using spatial analysis, indicating that it is more effective using both pre-blocking and post-blocking analyses in Swedish Norway spruce trials. The prediction accuracy for diameter and height for progeny breeding values showed an increase of 3.6 and 3.4%, respectively. The improvement of efficiency for growth traits is also related to the geographical location of test sites, tree age, number of survival trees, and the spacing of the trial.
   Conclusion The spatial analysis approach is more efficient in Swedish Norway spruce trials than the conventional methods using models based on the experimental design.

AB Key message Detailed measures of growth pattern and structural heterogeneity applied in this study helped to quantify the immediate effects of various thinning regimes on forest structure and the resulting alterations in tree size as well as observed longer term stand dynamics.
   Context Forest management, stand structure, and tree growth are highly inter-correlated. Prior analyses, however, have resulted in mixed outcomes with limited success in revealing ecological mechanisms.
   Aims The study aimed at evaluating the relationship between forest structure and stand dynamics by applying several sophisticated measures of growth pattern and structural heterogeneity.
   Methods Data from a controlled and fully stem-mapped commercial thinning experiment with seven contrasting treatments including a non-thinned control at six locations across the Acadian Forest of Maine, USA, was used. Stand-level attributes examined included tree size and growth heterogeneity, spatial tree distribution, and growth dominance.
   Results Thinning generally reduced stand structural heterogeneity compared to the non-thinned control. In addition, the spatial arrangement of trees changed from fully random (non-thinned control) to a more clustered (removal of dominant and co-dominant individuals) or regular distribution (removal of intermediate and suppressed individuals). Overall, stand growth exhibited increasing (non-thinned control, removal of intermediate and suppressed individuals) or decreasing growth dominance of large trees (removal of co-dominant competitors). Forwarder trails increased basal area growth of individual trees up to a distance from the trail of approximately 5 m.
   Conclusion Findings of this study validate an earlier insight according to which interactions between management practices, forest structure, and tree growth form a permanent feedback loop.

AB It has been suggested that deviance distraction is caused by unexpected sensory events in the to-be-ignored stimuli violating the cognitive system's predictions of incoming stimuli. The majority of research has used methods where the to-be-ignored expected (standards) and the unexpected (deviants) stimuli are presented within the same modality. Less is known about the behavioral impact of deviance distraction when the to-be-ignored stimuli are presented in different modalities (e.g., standard and deviants presented in different modalities). In three experiments using cross-modal oddball tasks with mixed-modality to-be-ignored stimuli, we examined the distractive role of unexpected auditory deviants presented in a continuous stream of expected standard vibrations. The results showed that deviance distraction seems to be dependent upon the to-be-ignored stimuli being presented within the same modality, and that the simplest omission of something expected; in this case, a standard vibration may be enough to capture attention and distract performance.

AB Disclosures in notes have been criticized by practitioners for being unwieldy and contributing little to the quality of the financial information. This study presents evidence on the association between disclosure quality, analyst following and liquidity in the real estate sector. More specifically, we study the disclosure of the methods and significant assumptions applied in determining fair values of investment properties under IAS 40 and IFRS 13. We find that disclosure quality is significantly higher under IFRS 13. Furthermore, we show that the quality is associated with analyst following and bid-ask spreads. However, the improved disclosures following the adoption of IFRS 13 are not associated with any significant positive economic consequences. This result indicates that the revised disclosure requirements in IFRS 13 did not solve any market imperfections.

AB Hydronic floor heating models provide predictions in estimating heat transfer rates and floor surface temperature. Information on the model performance and range of validity of its results are often lacking in literature. Researchers have to know the accuracy and robustness of the model outcomes for performing energy and climate comfort calculations. This article proposes a novel validation methodology based on the uncertainty analysis of input data/parameters of one-dimensional model of hydronic floor heating tested in a thermostatic booth simulator and compared with experimental measurements. The main results are: (1) prediction accuracy between 0.4% and 2.9% for (T) over bar (f) and between 0.7% and 7.8% for (q) over dot(up) when the serpentine has tube spacing (p) of 0.30m, (2) prediction accuracy between 0.5% and 1.4% for (T) over bar (f) and between 8.7% and 12.9% for (q) over dot(up) with p=0.15m and (3) (T) over bar (fld) mostly affects predictions with oscillations between 6.2% and 2.2% for (q) over dot(up). This model provides robust and reliable predictions exclusively for (q) over dot(up) when p=0.30m.

AB Identification of root avulsions is of critical importance in traumatic brachial plexus injuries because it alters the reconstruction and prognosis. Pre-operative magnetic resonance imaging is gaining popularity, but there is limited and conflicting data on its diagnostic accuracy for root avulsion. This cohort study describes consecutive patients requiring brachial plexus exploration following trauma between 2008 and 2016. The index test was magnetic resonance imaging at 1.5 Tesla and the reference test was operative exploration of the supraclavicular plexus. Complete data from 29 males was available. The diagnostic accuracy of magnetic resonance imaging for root avulsion(s) of C5-T1 was 79%. The diagnostic accuracy of a pseudomeningocoele as a surrogate marker of root avulsion(s) of C5-T1 was 68%. We conclude that pseudomeningocoles were not a reliable sign of root avulsion and magnetic resonance imaging has modest diagnostic accuracy for root avulsions in the context of adult traumatic brachial plexus injuries.

AB Obstetrical brachial plexus injury refers to injury observed at the time of delivery, which may lead to major functional impairment in the upper limb. In this study, the neuroprotective effect of early nerve repair following complete brachial plexus injury in neonatal rats was examined. Brachial plexus injury induced 90% loss of spinal motoneurons and 70% decrease in biceps muscle weight at 28 days after injury. Retrograde degeneration in spinal cord was associated with decreased density of dendritic branches and presynaptic boutons and increased density of astrocytes and macrophages/microglial cells. Early repair of the injured brachial plexus significantly delayed retrograde degeneration of spinal motoneurons and reduced the degree of macrophage/microglial reaction but had no effect on muscle atrophy. The results demonstrate that early nerve repair of neonatal brachial plexus injury could promote survival of injured motoneurons and attenuate neuroinflammation in spinal cord.

AB Background Shift work has been associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, there is a need for more studies to determine whether there is an interaction between shift work and other risk factors of CVD, thereby increasing the risk of CVD in shift workers.
   Aims To discern whether shift work and parental mortality from myocardial infarction (MI) or sudden cardiac death (SCD) interact to increase the risk of MI in men.
   Methods A case-control dataset was used to assess interaction between shift work and parental history of CVD, using death from MI or SCD, or death before age 65, on an additive scale. Results were reported as relative excess risk due to interaction, attributable proportion due to interaction (AP) and synergy index (SI).
   Results There was an interaction between shift work and paternal mortality from MI or SCD, when both factors were present [SI = 2.39; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.02. 5.6 and AP = 0.4; 95% CI 0.08. 0.73].
   Conclusions Paternal mortality from MI or SCD interacts with shift work to increase the risk of MI in men.

ID TEACHER-RESEARCHER COLLABORATION
AB We report an exploratory talk based, whole class plenary intervention, in relation to students' understanding of everyday measures and measurement, in a grade four classroom at a grade 4-6 school in Sweden. Extended, project related, teacher-researcher collaboration forms basis for such cultural historical activity theory or CHAT based efforts. As formative intervention, the conduct of the plenary is not pre-determined but embedded in ongoing curricular realities, with the agency of students and teacher promoted, pedagogical ideas reutilised and the role of researcher viewed as supporting design and growth of the intervention. Under Charlotta's guidance as teacher, the plenary is opportunity for her students to examine improbable scenarios such as, Can Eva and Anton measure the length of Sweden on foot, Can Lars and Iris measure their age in decimeters. A zone of proximal development is created, in which students make the transition from spontaneous to scientific concepts and learn how various units of measurement are objects-that-can-be-used-for-certain-purposes. With opportunity for critical and reflective inquiry, in a plenary designed to lead development, Charlotta's students look beyond the making of rote measurements and articulate a theory of measure in nascent terms. Such a landscape of teaching-learning is finally understood in terms of the nature of talk that was facilitated, the manner of pedagogy utilised, the style of teaching exercised and the kind of learning that was demanded of her students.

AB Studies on the association between heavy coffee consumption and risk of less frequently diagnosed cancers are scarce. We aimed to quantify the association between filtered, boiled, and total coffee consumption and the risk of bladder, esophageal, kidney, pancreatic, and stomach cancers. We used data from the Norwegian Women and Cancer Study and the Northern Sweden Health and Disease Study. Information on coffee consumption was available for 193,439 participants. We used multivariable Cox proportional hazards models to calculate hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the investigated cancer sites by category of total, filtered, and boiled coffee consumption. Heavy filtered coffee consumers (C 4 cups/day) had a multivariable adjusted HR of 0.74 of being diagnosed with pancreatic cancer (95% CI 0.57-0.95) when compared with light filtered coffee consumers (<= 1 cup/day). We did not observe significant associations between total or boiled coffee consumption and any of the investigated cancer sites, neither in the entire study sample nor in analyses stratified by sex. We found an increased risk of bladder cancer among never smokers who were heavy filtered or total coffee consumers, and an increased risk of stomach cancer in never smokers who were heavy boiled coffee consumers. Our data suggest that increased filtered coffee consumption might reduce the risk of pancreatic cancer. We did not find evidence of an association between coffee consumption and the risk of esophageal or kidney cancer. The increased risk of bladder and stomach cancer was confined to never smokers.

AB The aim of this study is to describe and analyse two recent quality assurance (QA) reforms in Swedish higher education (HE) and to discuss how shifts and continuities can be understood with a particular focus on the role of affects and emotions. Using conceptual devices from the literature on affects and emotions in the context of policy, official documents, media materials and interviews with stakeholders were analysed. In conclusion, the reforms were surrounded by distinctive affective atmospheres in which different emotional registers were circulated and articulated. The 2010 reform was criticised due to a lack of deliberation and produced a QA system described by HE actors in negative terms prior to its implementation. The second policy process after 2014 was emotionally reframed as being open for dialogue and collaboration in the creation of the reformed QA system. These affective atmospheres were framed by their particular policy histories and memories, but they also involved strategic attempts to create certain feelings, responses and actions.

AB Background: There is little reliable information on human exposure to the metals platinum (Pt), palladium (Pd) and rhodium (Rh), despite their use in enormous quantities in catalytic converters for automobile exhaust systems.
   Objectives: To evaluate blood concentrations of Pt (B-Pt), Pd (B-Pd) and Rh (B-Rh) in women from six European and three non-European countries, and to identify potentially influential factors. In addition, molybdenum (Mo) and strontium (Sr) were analysed.
   Methods: Blood from 248 women aged 47-61 was analysed by high resolution inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry under strict quality control.
   Results: The medians were: B-Pt 0.8 (range < 0.6-5.2), B-Pd < 5 (< 5-9.3), B-Rh < 0.4 (< 0.4-3.6) ng/L and BMo 2.0 (0.2-16) and B-Sr 16.6 (3.5-49) pg/L. Two women with highly elevated B-Pt (242 and 60 ng/L), previously cancer treated with cis-platinum, were not included in the data analysis. All elements varied geographically (2-3 times) (B-Pd P = 0.05; all other elements P < 0.001); variations within each area were generally 5-10 times. Traffic was not associated with increased concentrations.
   Conclusions: General population blood concentrations of Pt, Pd and Rh are within or below the single digit ng/L range, much lower than in most previous reports. This is probably due to improved analytical performance, allowing for more reliable information at ultra-trace levels. In general, Mo and Sr agreed with previously reported concentrations. All elements showed geographical and inter-individual variations, but no convincing relationships with self-reported traffic intensity were found. Pt from the antineoplastic drug cis-platinum it retained in the body for years.

AB Streptococcus mutans is a key bacterial species in the caries process, which affects > 90% of the population worldwide. However, other acidogenic and aciduric/acidophilic species may contribute to disease development. In Sweden, a country with low prevalences of caries and S. mutans, a significant portion of caries-affected adolescents lack detectable levels of S. mutans. The objectives of the present study were 1) to characterize the tooth biofilm and saliva microbiota of adolescents with caries disease, with or without detectable S. mutans, from tooth biofilm and saliva samples and 2) to assess taxa clustering in the tooth biofilm and saliva samples and relate this information to caries status. For 17-y-old participants (N = 154), enamel and dentin caries (the total number of present carious surfaces in the enamel and dentin) and caries experience (the number of decayed and filled tooth surfaces) were recorded, dental biofilm and saliva samples obtained, and information on medical and lifestyle habits collected. Multiplex 16S rDNA (V3-V4) sequencing of bacterial DNA was performed with the Illumina MiSeq platform. The Human Oral Microbiome Database and the ProbeSeq pipeline were used in the HOMINGS procedure. In subjects with caries experience, high levels of S. mutans were associated with a few species and low levels with a panel of saccharolytic species. Present caries was similarly associated with a panel of saccharolytic species in subjects without S. mutans. Furthermore, tooth biofilm microbiota could be used to establish 4 clusters of subjects with different caries experiences. In particular, high levels of S. mutans were associated with the presence of a few influential species in multivariate modeling, including Scardovia wiggsiae. By contrast, a panel of less avid lactic acid-producing species was influential in patients with undetectable or low S. mutans levels in such modeling. These findings support a prominent role of S. mutans in infected adolescents but also the ecologic concept, especially in S. mutans-free subjects.

AB We report the use of a single layer of two-dimensional hexagonal boron nitride (SL-hBN) as the thinnest insulating barrier to microbial corrosion induced by the sulfate-reducing bacteria Desulfovibrio alaskensis G20. We used electrochemical methods to assess the corrosion resistance of SL-hBN on copper against the effects of both the planktonic and sessile forms of the sulfate-reducing bacteria. Cyclic voltammetry results show that SL-hBN-Cu is effective in suppressing corrosion effects of the planktonic cells at potentials as high as 0.2 V (vs Ag/AgCl). The peak anodic current for the SL-hBN coatings is similar to 36 times lower than that of bare Cu. Linear polarization resistance tests confirm that the SL-hBN coatings serve as a barrier against corrosive effects of the G20 biofilm when compared to bare Cu. The SL-hBN serves as an impermeable barrier to aggressive metabolites and offers similar to 91% corrosion inhibition efficiency, which is comparable to much thicker commercial coatings such as polyaniline. In addition to impermeability, the insulating nature of SL-hBN suppresses galvanic effects and improves its ability to combat microbial corrosion.

AB The atmosphere is the major contributor of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs) in the Baltic Sea environment. In this study, we investigated the potential of using metals along with PCDD/Fs as markers of important emission sources of PCDD/Fs in air. The air concentrations of PCDD/F congeners (n = 17), other persistent organic pollutants (n = 8) and metals (n = 16) were determined in summer and winter air using high volume samplers at a rural field station (Aspvreten, Sweden) located close to the Baltic Sea coast. During winter, PCDD/F levels were on average 20 times higher than in summer (5.1 +/- 5.8 fg toxicity equivalents (TEQ) m(-3) and 0.26 +/- 0.18 fg TEQ m(-3), respectively) mostly due to a higher fraction of PCDFs. The increased levels of PCDD/Fs were pronounced mainly in air masses that had travelled from southern (S) and eastern (E) compass sectors. A principal component analysis (PCA) of metal levels in Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) needles sampled to reflect various air emission source types helped to identify potential marker metals for selected known atmospheric emission sources of PCDD/Fs and to rank among the candidate source types. Brown coal burning, domestic burning and heavy oil burning appeared to be the source types that contribute most of the PCDD/Fs in Baltic Sea air. The current study demonstrates a successful approach for source tracing of PCDD/Fs in air, where integrated indices from seasonal and spatial patterns of PCDD/Fs as well as metal source markers were used to trace and rank sources.

AB The expected costs of population ageing have generally led to perceived needs to postpone the age of retirement. Drawing on 20 semi-structured interviews, the aim of this paper is to describe the ways that the possibility of an extended working life is comprehended by persons over the age of 60 living in sparsely populated areas in northern Sweden. While defining themselves as active, the interviewees argued strongly in favour of the right to retire. What are often described as opposing retiree subject positions healthy and active vs. vulnerable and dependent were partly transgressed in the interviews. The interviewees performed a solidarity that had the potential of including their future selves as possible objects of solidarity. Another important result was that in comprehending the possibility of an extended working life, morally charged notions of geographic place became central.

AB Ribonucleotides (rNMPs) are frequently incorporated during replication or repair by DNA polymerases and failure to remove them leads to instability of nuclear DNA (nDNA). Conversely, rNMPs appear to be relatively well-tolerated in mitochondnal DNA (mtDNA), although the mechanisms behind the tolerance remain unclear. We here show that the human mitochondrial DNA polymerase gamma (Pol gamma) bypasses single rNMPs with an unprecedentedly high fidelity and efficiency. In addition, Pol gamma exhibits a strikingly low frequency of rNMP incorporation, a property, which we find is independent of its exonuclease activity. However, the physiological levels of free rNTPs partially inhibit DNA synthesis by Pol gamma and render the polymerase more sensitive to imbalanced dNTP pools. The characteristics of Pol gamma reported here could have implications for forms of rntDNA depletion syndrome (MDS) that are associated with imbalanced cellular dNTP pools. Our results show that at the rNTPidNIP ratios that are expected to prevail in such disease states, Pol gamma enters a polymerasetexonuclease idling mode that leads to mtDNA replication stalling. This could ultimately lead to mtDNA depletion and, consequently, to mitochondrial disease phenotypes such as those observed in MDS.

AB Background/Aim: Prostate cancer (PCa) diagnosis using patient urine samples represents a non-invasive and more convenient method than the conventional biopsy and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test. This study intended to identify a biomarker panel to distinguish PCa from benign prostate using urine samples. Materials and Methods: We identified six biomarkers with differential gene expression in 154 PCa and benign prostate specimens. We then determined mRNA expression signature and the diagnostic performance of the 6-biomarker panel in 156 urine samples from patients with PCa and benign disease. Results: The 6-biomarker panel distinguished PCa from benign prostate cases with sensitivity of 80.6%, specificity of 62.9% and area under the curve (AUC) of 0.803 (p<0.0001), whereas serum PSA at 4 ng/ml cutoff had sensitivity of 95.5%, specificity of 20.2% and AUC of 0.521 (p<0.0001). Conclusion: The 6-biomarker panel for use in urine samples was able to distinguish PCa from benign prostate with higher specificity and accuracy than PSA and may be useful in clinical settings.

AB An organism's life history is closely interlinked with its allocation of energy between growth and reproduction at different life stages. Theoretical models have established that diminishing returns from reproductive investment promote strategies with simultaneous investment into growth and reproduction (indeterminate growth) over strategies with distinct phases of growth and reproduction (determinate growth). We extend this traditional, binary classification by showing that allocation-dependent fecundity and mortality rates allow for a large diversity of optimal allocation schedules. By analyzing a model of organisms that allocate energy between growth and reproduction, we find twelve types of optimal allocation schedules, differing qualitatively in how reproductive allocation increases with body mass. These twelve optimal allocation schedules include types with different combinations of continuous and discontinuous increase in reproduction allocation, in which phases of continuous increase can be decelerating or accelerating. We furthermore investigate how this variation influences growth curves and the expected maximum life span and body size. Our study thus reveals new links between eco-physiological constraints and life-history evolution and underscores how allocation-dependent fitness components may underlie biological diversity.

This paper argues for the need of design histories that also address the origins of our design methods with respect to contexts, values and ideas in order to understand what these actually bring to the contemporary design situation. To illustrate what such a historical approach to design methods might bring, we present a study on the origins of Scandinavian user-centered design. In particular, we discuss the Home Research Institute's (HFI) development of methods for investigating and reforming everyday life and domestic work in mid-1940s Sweden.

TI Thinking with Interactive Artifacts: Reflection as a Concept in Design

SO DESIGN ISSUES

DT Article
DE reflection; interactive artifacts; behavior change; materiality and
   tangibility

AB Reflection is a recurring notion in the HCI/interaction design literature. Throughout the years reflection has been highlighted as a key dimension of design thinking and as an important ingredient of design processes. In this paper we take stock in our community's interest in reflection, and we suggest that while it has been acknowledged as a cornerstone for design processes, it has been less explored as a basis for design outcomes. Given this extensive literature study, it seems that 1) the interest in this area is growing, and we present tables that illustrate this growing interest over time; 2) reflection and behavioral change are two interrelated notions; and 3) these notions are well-explored in our field. Further, we suggest that as interaction design is increasingly exploring the design of tangible, smart, connected, and even intelligent artifacts, we should think about how reflection and our ability to think with artifacts can be extended to include the design of interactive artifacts. In this paper we suggest how that might be done, and we point at a design space for designing such interactive artifacts to think with.

AB Executive function (EF) skills are crucial for pupils' learning. Therefore, incorporating well-considered instructional strategies may reduce the EF demands placed on pupils with insufficient EF skills in the classroom. Hence, educators are critically positioned. In the present study, 303 student teachers answered the Mathematics Skills Questionnaire. The aim of the study was to ( a) examine how student teachers rated the importance of EF skills and EF-related skills involved in pupils' learning and (b) investigate whether there were any differences in rating between regular student teachers and special needs student educators. The results of a two-way mixed ANOVA showed a significant main effect of skill in the total sample. Follow-up tests revealed that skills such as reasoning and proof, inhibition, shifting, and creativity were rated as more important when compared to other skills. Follow-up comparison of the significant interaction effect between skill and student teacher group revealed that the special needs student teachers regarded working memory skills as more important, while the regular student teachers rated EF-related skills that are grounded in core EF skills to have higher importance. The science of learning and its educational implications are discussed.

AB Introduction: The 2-year Finnish Geriatric Intervention Study to Prevent Cognitive Impairment and Disability (FINGER) multidomain lifestyle intervention trial (NCT01041989) demonstrated beneficial effects on cognition. We investigated whether sociodemographics, socioeconomic status, baseline cognition, or cardiovascular factors influenced intervention effects on cognition.
   Methods: The FINGER recruited 1260 people from the general Finnish population (60-77 years, at risk for dementia). Participants were randomized 1: 1 to multidomain intervention (diet, exercise, cognition, and vascular risk management) and regular health advice. Primary outcome was change in cognition (Neuropsychological Test Battery z-score). Prespecified analyses to investigate whether participants' characteristics modified response to intervention were carried out using mixed-model repeated-measures analyses.
   Results: Sociodemographics (sex, age, and education), socioeconomic status (income), cognition (Mini-Mental State Examination), cardiovascular factors (body mass index, blood pressure, cholesterol, fasting glucose, and overall cardiovascular risk), and cardiovascular comorbidity did not modify response to intervention (P-values for interaction > .05).
   Conclusions: The FINGER intervention was beneficial regardless of participants' characteristics and can thus be implemented in a large elderly population at increased risk for dementia. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc. on behalf of the Alzheimer's Association.

TI Can State Supervision Improve Eldercare? An Analysis of the Soundness of
   the Swedish Supervision Model
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF SOCIAL WORK

DE State supervision; Sweden; eldercare quality; intended effects;
   unintended effects
ID OLDER-PEOPLE; CARE; QUALITY; SWEDEN; RISK
AB This article examines the assumptions regarding how Swedish state supervision (SSV) of eldercare is to achieve its intended effects. It explores how SSV is intended to work to ensure and improve eldercare quality, and theoretically and empirically assesses the validity of its guiding assumptions with programme theory methodology. The theoretical assessment suggests that most intended effects are partly achieved, though the quality-enhancing assumption finds little support in caring research. The assumption that the supervised parties will improve their compliance with laws and regulations has some validity, but this compliance is temporary and confined to the aspects of eldercare being supervised. Twenty-four interviews with the chairs of Social Welfare Committees and care unit managers provide empirical support for all but two intended effects. SSV has not increased 'awareness of national regulative demands in eldercare' or contributed to 'general quality improvement in eldercare'. Four unintended effects of SSV were also recognised in the interviews-for example, unsupervised caring activities were less prioritised. The authors conclude that, although SSV does little to improve eldercare quality, it is needed for transparency and accountability as well as to hold local governments and public and private service providers to account for compliance with national statutes.

AB In this longitudinal interview study, we have strived to advance the understanding of how organisational factors may hinder the emergence of transformational leadership among first line managers in social service organisations. By interviewing managers in a Swedish social service organisation during their first year of leadership, we first identified leadership ideals and then asked them to identify factors that hinder the performance of this leadership. Qualitative content analysis was used to analyse the data and the results revealed that the managers strived for a transformational leadership, but several factors in the organisation made it difficult to lead in the way they intended. Hindering factors were identified both at the organisational level, such as 'top-down management', 'financial strain' and 'continuous change', and in the managers' own working environment in terms of no support', 'high work-load', 'limited influence', 'administrative tasks' and 'distance to employees'. This study contributes to our understanding of organisational antecedents of transformational leadership as well as the premises of transformational leadership in social service organisations.

AB Objective To investigate the effects of local vibration on muscle strength in healthy adults.
   Data sources The electronic databases PubMed, CINAHL, Scopus and Web of Science were searched using a combination of the following keywords: vibration, vibration therapy, power, maximal voluntary contraction, performance, rate of force development and vibratory exercise. In addition, the Medical Subject Headings 'vibration', 'strength' and 'exercise' were used. The bibliographical search was limited to articles published in English.
   Study selection Trials that evaluated the effect of localised vibration on muscle strength in healthy humans were included.
   Data extraction Two independent evaluators verified the quality of the selected studies using the PEDro Scale and the Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing the risk of bias. Muscle strength was calculated for each intervention.
   Results In total, 29 full-text studies were assessed for eligibility. Eighteen studies did not match the inclusion criteria, and were excluded. The 11 studies included in this review had an average PEDro score of 5.36/10. Most of the studies reported significant improvements in muscle strength after the application of local vibration. There was considerable variation in the vibration training parameters and target muscle location.
   Conclusions The use of local vibration on the target muscle can enhance muscle strength in healthy adults. Further well-designed controlled studies are required to confirm the effect of local vibration training on muscle strength. (C) 2017 Chartered Society of Physiotherapy. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB This article examines how administrators in social services (n=70) and habilitation staff in healthcare (n=40) in Sweden experience difficulties in their work with people with intellectual disabilities. The research aim was to investigate the most typical aspects of difficult working situations and to apply a comparative analysis of differences and similarities, where the respondents' organizational affiliations are taken into account. The results are primarily based on a content analysis. Contextual standardized questions were included in this study. The results revealed that experiences of difficulties were categorized in four typological themes: difficult situations associated with (1) structure, (2) professional role, (3) relationships, and (4) collaboration. The respondents' experiences of difficult situations in social services and healthcare organizations did not correspond to the respondents' work dissatisfaction or unclear goals. On the contrary, handling this plurality within a specific organizational context was a fundamental aspect of professionalism. The different characteristics of the organizations in this study reflected two different institutional logics. While the administrators mainly operated within an administrative logic based on a regulatory framework, the habilitation staff operated within a therapeutic logic based on a cognitive framework. Consequently, the two groups had their own specific norms and rule systems, which influenced when, and to what extent, everyday situations were experienced and defined as difficult. The organizational context seems to influence experiences of difficult situations in the work with people with ID and this calls for a discussion of how it impacts the quality of services within intellectual disability services.

AB PurposeWe describe a public dataset with MR and CT images of patients performed in the same position with both multiobserver and expert consensus delineations of relevant organs in the male pelvic region. The purpose was to provide means for training and validation of segmentation algorithms and methods to convert MR to CT like data, i.e., so called synthetic CT (sCT).
   Acquisition and validation methodsT1- and T2-weighted MR images as well as CT data were collected for 19 patients at three different departments. Five experts delineated nine organs for each patient based on the T2-weighted MR images. An automatic method was used to fuse the delineations. Starting from each fused delineation, a consensus delineation was agreed upon by the five experts for each organ and patient. Segmentation overlap between user delineations with respect to the consensus delineations was measured to describe the spread of the collected data. Finally, an open-source software was used to create deformation vector fields describing the relation between MR and CT images to further increase the usability of the dataset.
   Data format and usage notesThe dataset has been made publically available to be used for academic purposes, and can be accessed from .
   Potential applicationsThe dataset provides a useful source for training and validation of segmentation algorithms as well as methods to convert MR to CT-like data (sCT). To give some examples: The T2-weighted MR images with their consensus delineations can directly be used as a template in an existing atlas-based segmentation engine; the expert delineations are useful to validate the performance of a segmentation algorithm as they provide a way to measure variability among users which can be compared with the result of an automatic segmentation; and the pairwise deformably registered MR and CT images can be a source for an atlas-based sCT algorithm or for validation of sCT algorithm.

ID INTERNET
AB Continuous detection of performance anomalies such as service degradations has become critical in cloud and Internet services due to impact on quality of service and end-user experience. However, the volume and fast changing behavior of metric streams have rendered it a challenging task. Many diagnosis frameworks often rely on thresholding with stationarity or normality assumption, or on complex models requiring extensive offline training. Such techniques are known to be prone to spurious false-alarms in online settings as metric streams undergo rapid contextual changes from known baselines. Hence, we propose two unsupervised incremental techniques following a two-step strategy. First, we estimate an underlying temporal property of the stream via adaptive learning and, then we apply statistically robust control charts to recognize deviations. We evaluated our techniques by replaying over 40 time-series streams from the Yahoo! Webscope S5 datasets as well as four other traces of real Web service QoS and ISP traffic measurements. Our methods achieve high detection accuracy and few false-alarms, and better performance in general compared to an open-source package for time-series anomaly detection.

AB Hamstring injuries occur commonly in athletes participating in sports that require sprinting/high velocity running, kicking a ball or agility. In the first instance, clinical assessment and management play a pivotal role in managing these injuries. Radiological investigations such as ultrasonography (US) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are also recommended to confirm one or more parameters related to hamstring injury (the location, length, cross-sectional area, volume, edema, hemorrhage, etc.) and predicting return-to-play. However, hamstring injuries that are minor in nature, diagnosed clinically, may not be discernible on conventional US or MRI in some cases. Certain reasons for these paradoxical (clinical vs. radiological) findings may include pain referral to the posterior thigh from lumbosacral dysfunction or sciatic nerve pathoneurodynamics. Conversely, minor hamstring injuries might remain indiscernible within the threshold of conventional MRI sensitivity. To date, there is neither clear consensus on a standardized criteria nor strong evidence for using MRI to prognosticate return-to-play following hamstring injuries. This paper briefly discusses the controversy between contradicting clinical and radiological findings encountered by clinicians in the diagnosis of minor hamstring injuries. If posterior thigh pain appears with clinical signs and symptoms of a minor hamstring injury without pain referral from neighboring structures, but presents with negative findings on US or MRI, the diagnosis remains a challenge. However, such conditions are pragmatically treated as (nonstructural) hamstring injuries unless certain differential diagnoses can be established. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Behavioural analysis based on video recording is becoming increasingly popular within research fields such as; ecology, medicine, ecotoxicology and toxicology. However, the programs available to analyse the data, which are free of cost, user-friendly, versatile, robust, fast and provide reliable statistics for different organisms (invertebrates, vertebrates and mammals) are significantly limited. We present an automated open-source executable software (ToxTrac) for image-based tracking that can simultaneously handle several organisms monitored in a laboratory environment. We compare the performance of ToxTrac with current accessible programs on the web. The main advantages of ToxTrac are as follows: (i) no specific knowledge of the geometry of the tracked bodies is needed; (ii) processing speed, ToxTrac can operate at a rate >25 frames per second in HD videos using modern computers; (iii) simultaneous tracking of multiple organisms in multiple arenas; (iv) integrated distortion correction and camera calibration; (v) robust against false positives; (vi) preservation of individual identification; (vii) useful statistics and heat maps in real scale are exported in image, text and excel formats.ToxTrac can be used for high speed tracking of insects, fish, rodents or other species, and provides useful locomotor information in animal behavior experiments.

AB Detection of DNA in lake sediments holds promise as a tool to study processes like extinction, colonization, adaptation and evolutionary divergence. However, low concentrations make sediment DNA difficult to detect, leading to high false negative rates. Additionally, contamination could potentially lead to high false positive rates. Careful laboratory procedures can reduce false positive and negative rates, but should not be assumed to completely eliminate them. Therefore, methods are needed that identify potential false positive and negative results, and use this information to judge the plausibility of different interpretations of DNA data from natural archives. We developed a Bayesian algorithm to infer the colonization history of a species using records of DNA from lake-sediment cores, explicitly labelling some observations as false positive or false negative. We illustrate the method by analysing DNA of whitefish (Coregonus lavaretus L.) from sediment cores covering the past 10,000years from two central Swedish lakes. We provide the algorithm as an R-script, and the data from this study as example input files. In one lake, Stora Logdasjon, where connectivity with the proto-Baltic Sea and the degree of whitefish ecotype differentiation suggested colonization immediately after deglaciation, DNA was indeed successfully recovered and amplified throughout the post-glacial sediment. For this lake, we found no loss of detection probability over time, but a high false negative rate. In the other lake, Hotagen, where connectivity and ecotype differentiation suggested colonization long after deglaciation, DNA was amplified only in the upper part of the sediment, and colonization was estimated at 2,200bp based on the assumption that successful amplicons represent whitefish presence. Here the earliest amplification represents a false positive with a posterior probability of 41%, which increases the uncertainty in the estimated time of colonization. Complementing careful laboratory procedures aimed at preventing contamination, our method estimates contamination rates from the data. By combining these results with estimates of false negative rates, our models facilitate unbiased interpretation of data from natural DNA archives.

AB Adherent cell culture typically requires cell spreading at the surface of solid substrates to sustain the formation of stable focal adhesions and assembly of a contractile cytoskeleton. However, a few reports have demonstrated that cell culture is possible on liquid substrates such as silicone and fluorinated oils, even displaying very low viscosities (0.77 cSt). Such behavior is surprising as low viscosity liquids are thought to relax much too fast (<ms) to enable the stabilization of focal adhesions (with lifetimes on the order of minutes to hours). Here we show that cell spreading and proliferation at the surface of low viscosity liquids are enabled by the self-assembly of mechanically strong protein nanosheets at these interfaces. We propose that this phenomenon results from the denaturation of globular proteins, such as albumin, in combination with the coupling of surfactant molecules to the resulting protein nanosheets. We use interfacial rheology and atomic force microscopy indentation to characterize the mechanical properties of protein nanosheets and associated liquid liquid interfaces. We identify a direct relationship between interfacial mechanics and the association of surfactant molecules with proteins and polymers assembled at liquid liquid interfaces. In addition, our data indicate that cells primarily sense in-plane mechanical properties of interfaces, rather than relying on surface tension to sustain spreading, as in the spreading of water striders. These findings demonstrate that bulk and nanoscale mechanical properties may be designed independently, to provide structure and regulate cell phenotype, therefore calling for a paradigm shift for the design of biomaterials in regenerative medicine.

AB Background: Malignant potential of small (<= 20 mm) nonfunctional pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (sNF-PNET) is difficult to predict and management remain controversial. The aim of this study was to assess the prognosis of sporadic nonmetastatic sNF-PNETs.
   Methods: Patients were identified from databases of 16 centers. Outcomes and risk factors for recurrence were identified by uni-and multivariate analyses.
   Results: sNF-PNET was resected in 210 patients, and 66% (n = 138) were asymptomatic. Median age was 60 years, median tumor size was 15 mm, parenchyma-sparing surgery was performed in 42%. Postoperative mortality was 0.5% (n = 1), severe morbidity rate was 14.3% (n = 30), and 14 of 132 patients (10.6%) with harvested lymph nodes had metastatic lymph nodes. Tumor size, presence of biliary or pancreatic duct dilatation, and WHO grade 2-3 were independently associated with recurrence. Patients with tumors sized <= 10 mm were disease free at last follow-up. The 1-, 3- and 5-year disease-free survival rates for patients with tumors sized 11-20 mm on preoperative imaging were 95.1%, 91.0%, and 87.3%, respectively.
   Conclusions: In sNF-PNETs, the presence of biliary or pancreatic duct dilatation or WHO grade 2-3 advocate for surgical treatment. In the remaining patients, a wait-and-see policy might be considered.

AB IMPORTANCE Comparative real-world effectiveness studies of initial disease-modifying treatment (DMT) choices for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) that include rituximab are lacking.
   OBJECTIVE To assess the effectiveness and drug discontinuation rates of rituximab among patients with newly diagnosed RRMS compared with injectable DMTs, dimethyl fumarate, fingolimod, or natalizumab.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS This retrospective cohort study used prospectively collected data to examine specialized care of 2 Swedish county-based community samples of patients with RRMS. Patients with RRMS who received diagnoses from January 1, 2012, to October 31, 2015, who resided in Stockholm or Vasterbotten Counties were identified from a Swedish multiple sclerosis registry.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES All reasons for drug discontinuation of initial treatment choice (main outcome) and specific reasons for switching (secondary outcomes) were analyzed with multivariable Cox regression, including propensity scores.
   RESULTS Among 494 patients (median [interquartile range] age, 34.4 [27.4-43.4] years; 158 men [32.0%]), 215 received an injectable DMT (43.5%); 86 (17.4%), dimethyl fumarate; 17 (3.4%), fingolimod; 50 (10.1%), natalizumab; 120 (24.3%), rituximab; and 6 (1.2%), other DMT. Regional preferences were pronounced, with 42 of 52 (81%) and 78 of 442 (18%) receiving rituximab in Vasterbotten and Stockholm, respectively. The annual discontinuation rate for rituximab, injectable DMTs, dimethyl fumarate, fingolimod, and natalizumab were 0.03, 0.53, 0.32, 0.38, and 0.29, respectively. Continued disease activity was the main reason for discontinuation of injectable DMTs, dimethyl fumarate, and fingolimod; positive John Cunningham virus serology results were the main reason for discontinuation of natalizumab. Rate of clinical relapses and/or neuroradiologic disease activity were significantly lower for rituximab compared with injectable DMTs and dimethyl fumarate, with a tendency for lower relapse rates also compared with natalizumab and fingolimod. The annual discontinuation rate of initial treatment choice was significantly lower in Vasterbotten compared with Stockholm (0.09 and 0.37, respectively).
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Rituximab was superior to all other DMT in terms of drug discontinuation and displayed better clinical efficacy compared with injectable DMTs and dimethyl fumarate with borderline significance compared with natalizumab and fingolimod. The county where rituximab constituted the main initial treatment choice displayed better outcomes in most measured variables. Collectively, our findings suggest that rituximab performs better than other commonly used DMTs in patients with newly diagnosed RRMS.

TI Efficacy and Safety of Deep Brain Stimulation in Tourette Syndrome The
   International Tourette Syndrome Deep Brain Stimulation Public Database
   and Registry
SO JAMA NEUROLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID PARKINSONS-DISEASE; RECOMMENDATIONS
AB IMPORTANCE Collective evidence has strongly suggested that deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a promising therapy for Tourette syndrome.
   OBJECTIVE To assess the efficacy and safety of DBS in a multinational cohort of patients with Tourette syndrome.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The prospective International Deep Brain Stimulation Database and Registry included 185 patients with medically refractory Tourette syndrome who underwent DBS implantation from January 1, 2012, to December 31, 2016, at 31 institutions in 10 countries worldwide.
   EXPOSURES Patients with medically refractory symptoms received DBS implantation in the centromedian thalamic region (93 of 163 [57.1%]), the anterior globus pallidus internus (41 of 163 [25.2%]), the posterior globus pallidus internus (25 of 163 [15.3%]), and the anterior limb of the internal capsule (4 of 163 [2.5%]).
   MAINOUTCOMES AND MEASURES Scores on the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale and adverse events.
   RESULTS The International Deep Brain Stimulation Database and Registry enrolled 185 patients (of 171 with available data, 37 females and 134 males; mean [SD] age at surgery, 29.1 [10.8] years [range, 13-58 years]). Symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder were present in 97 of 151 patients (64.2%) and 32 of 148 (21.6%) had a history of self-injurious behavior. The mean (SD) total Yale Global Tic Severity Scale score improved from 75.01 (18.36) at baseline to 41.19 (20.00) at 1 year after DBS implantation (P<.001). The mean (SD) motor tic subscore improved from 21.00 (3.72) at baseline to 12.91 (5.78) after 1 year (P <.001), and the mean (SD) phonic tic subscore improved from 16.82 (6.56) at baseline to 9.63 (6.99) at 1 year (P <.001). The overall adverse event rate was 35.4%(56 of 158 patients), with intracranial hemorrhage occurring in 2 patients (1.3%), infection in 4 patients with 5 events (3.2%), and lead explantation in 1 patient (0.6%). The most common stimulation-induced adverse effects were dysarthria (10 [6.3%]) and paresthesia (13 [8.2%]).
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Deep brain stimulationwas associated with symptomatic improvement in patients with Tourette syndrome but also with important adverse events. A publicly available website on outcomes of DBS in patients with Tourette syndrome has been provided.

AB In recent years, a number of quantum mechanical-molecular mechanical (QM/MM) enzyme studies have investigated the dependence of reaction energetics on the size of the QM region using energy and free energy calculations. In this study, we revisit the question of QM region size dependence in QM/MM simulations within the context of energy and free energy calculations using a proton transfer in a DNA base pair as a test case. In the simulations, the QM region was treated with a dispersion-corrected AM1/d-PhoT Hamiltonian, which was developed to accurately describe phosphoryl and proton transfer reactions, in conjunction with an electrostatic embedding scheme using the particle-mesh Ewald summation method. With this rigorous QM/MM potential, we performed rather extensive QM/MM sampling, and found that the free energy reaction profiles converge rapidly with respect to the QM region size within ca. +/- 1 kcal/mol. This finding suggests that the strategy of QM/MM simulations with reasonably sized and selected QM regions, which has been employed for over four decades, is a valid approach for modeling complex biomolecular systems. We point to possible causes for the sensitivity of the energy and free energy calculations to the size of the QM region, and potential implications.

AB The use of prostate MR imaging in radiotherapy continues to evolve. This article describes its current application in the selection of treatment regimens, integration in treatment planning or simulation, and assessment of response. An expert consensus statement from the annual MR in RT symposium is presented, as a list of 21 key quality indicators for the practice of MR imaging simulation in prostate cancer. Although imaging requirements generally follow PIRADSv2 guidelines, additional requirements specific to radiotherapy planning are described. MR imaging-only workflows and MR imaging-guided treatment systems are expected to replace conventional computed tomography-based practice, further adding specific requirements for MR imaging in radiotherapy.

TI Sagittal lumbopelvic alignment in patients with low back pain and the
   effects of a high-load lifting exercise and individualized low-load
   motor control exercises-a randomized controlled trial

AB BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Assessment of posture and lumbopelvic alignment is often the main focus in the classification and treatment of patients with low back pain (LBP). However, little is known regarding the effects of motor control interventions on objective measures of lumbopelvic alignment.
   PURPOSE: The primary aim of this study was to describe the variation of sagittal lumbopelvic alignment in patients with nociceptive mechanical LBP. The secondary aim was to compare the effects of a high-load lifting exercise (HLL) and low-load motor control exercises (LMC) on the change in lumbopelvic alignment with a special emphasis on patients with high and low degrees of lumbar lordosis (lu) and sacral angle (sa).
   STUDY DESIGN: This study is a secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial evaluating the effects of HLL and LMC.
   PATIENT SAMPLE: Patients from the primary study, that is, patients categorized with nociceptive mechanical LBP, who agreed to participate in the radiographic examination were included (n=66).
   OUTCOME MEASURES: Lateral plain radiographic images were used to evaluate lumbopelvic alignment regarding the lumbar lordosis and the sacral angle as outcomes, with posterior bend as an explanatory variable.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: The participants were recruited to the study from two occupational health-care facilities. They were randomized to either the HLL or the LMC intervention group and offered 12 supervised exercise sessions. Outcome measures were collected at baseline and following the end of intervention period 2 months after baseline. Between-and within-group analyses of intervention groups and subgroups based on the distribution of the baseline values for the lumbar lordosis and the sacral angle, respectively (LOW, MID, and HIGH), were performed using both parametric and non-parametric statistics.
   RESULTS: The ranges of values for the present sample were 26.9-91.6 degrees (M=59.0 degrees, standard deviation [SD]=11.5 degrees) for the lumbar lordosis and 18.2-72.1 degrees (M=42.0 degrees, SD=9.6 degrees) for the sacral angle. There were no significant differences between the intervention groups in the percent change of either outcome measure. Neither did any outcome change significantly over time within the intervention groups. In the subgroups, based on the distribution of respective baseline values, LOWlu showed a significantly increased lumbar lordosis, whereas HIGH(sa) showed a significantly decreased sacral angle following intervention.
   CONCLUSIONS: This study describes the wide distribution of values for lumbopelvic alignment for patients with nociceptive mechanical LBP. Further research is needed to investigate subgroups of other types of LBP and contrast findings to those presented in this study. Our results also suggest that retraining of the lumbopelvic alignment could be possible for patients with LBP. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

   SOCIETY
AB Background We evaluated whether early measurement of soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR) could predict future risk of postoperative complications in initially asymptomatic patients with mild-moderate aortic stenosis (AS) undergoing aortic valve replacement (AVR) surgery.
   Methods Baseline plasma suPAR levels were available in 411 patients who underwent AVR surgery during in the Simvastatin and Ezetimibe in Aortic Stenosis (SEAS) study. Cox analyses were used to evaluate suPAR in relation to all-cause mortality and the composite endpoint of postoperative complications (all-cause mortality, congestive heart failure, stroke and renal impairment) occurring in the 30-day postoperative period.
   Results Patients with initially higher levels of suPAR were at increased risk of postoperative mortality with a HR of 3.5 (95% CI 1.4 to 9.0, P=0.008) and postoperative complications with a HR of 2.7 (95% CI 1.5 to 5.1, P=0.002), per doubling in suPAR. After adjusting for the European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation or Society of Thoracic Surgeons risk score, suPAR remained associated with postoperative mortality with a HR 3.2 (95% CI 1.2 to 8.6, P=0.025) and 2.7 (95% CI 1.0 to 7.8, P=0.061); and postoperative complications with a HR of 2.5 (95% CI 1.3 to 5.0, P=0.007) and 2.4 (95% CI 1.2 to 4.8, P=0.011), respectively.
   Conclusion Higher baseline suPAR levels are associated with an increased risk for postoperative complications and mortality in patients with mild-moderate, asymptomatic AS undergoing later AVR surgery. Further validation in other subsets of AS individuals are warranted.

AB Graphs have a variety of uses in natural language processing, particularly as representations of linguistic meaning. A deficit in this area of research is a formal framework for creating, combining, and using models involving graphs that parallels the frameworks of finite automata for strings and finite tree automata for trees. A possible starting point for such a framework is the formalism of directed acyclic graph (DAG) automata, defined by Kamimura and Slutzki and extended by Quernheim and Knight. In this article, we study the latter in depth, demonstrating several new results, including a practical recognition algorithm that can be used for inference and learning with models defined on DAG automata. We also propose an extension to graphs with unbounded node degree and show that our results carry over to the extended formalism.

AB Objective: The aim was to evaluate surgical routes for benign hysterectomy in a Swedish population, including abdominal and minimally invasive surgery.
   Study design: Prospectively collected data from the Swedish National GynOp Registry 2009-2015: 13 806 hysterectomy cases were included: abdominal (AH, n = 7485), vaginal (VH, n = 3767), conventional laparoscopic (LH, n = 1539) and robotically-assisted (RAH, n = 1015).
   Results: The VH group had the shortest operation time at 75 min, AH 97 min and RAH 104 min. LH was longest at 127 min (p < 0.005). The mean estimated blood loss was higher in the AH group (250 ml) compared to all minimally invasive surgery (MIS, 65-172 ml): p < 0.005).
   Conversion rates were 10% for LH, 4.8% for VH and 1.6% for RAH (p < 0.005). Hospitalization and patient reported time to normal activities of daily living (ADL) were longer for AH compared to MIS (p < 0.005). Time to return to work was eight days longer in the AN group (35 days) compared with the MIS groups (p < 0.005).
   Complications were fewest in the VH group at 5.4% compared with AH 7.6% and RAH 8.7% (both p < 0.001), but did not significantly differ from the LH group at 6.6%. Overall patient satisfaction was reported to be 86-94% one year after surgery.
   Conclusion: Women operated on for benign hysterectomy with minimally invasive methods in Sweden 2009-2015 had reduced length of hospitalization, as well as time to resuming normal ADL and return to work, compared to AH. Postoperative outcome measures were improved by minimally invasive methods and MIS should preferably be used. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Bilberry presscake, a byproduct from juice production, contains abundant polysaccharides that can be recovered by thermal treatment. In this research, microwave hydrolysis and extraction were carried out using only water as the processing medium, thus ensuring all products (mainly saccharides) are suitable for food grade status applications. This research aims to propose an approach to fulfill multiple chemicals recovery, including anthocyanins, saccharides, proteins, and even inorganic salts. Statistical analysis suggested the conversion of bilberry presscake was accurately predictable (R-2 of 0.986) from conditions. Of the variables temperature, holding time, and solid content, the solid content affects conversion most significantly. A 30 min microwave hydrolysis gives mono-/disaccharides with a high total yield of 24.9%, which is more than three times the yield of a 24 h Soxhlet extraction (7.1%). The yield of rhamnose is particularly high (10.8%), most likely as a result of pectin degradation on microwave irradiation. In addition to the lab scale research, pilot scale microwave extractions are carried out with high conversion (especially glucose 4.4%, xylose 4.0%, and pectin 6.3%), suggesting the feasibility of low-temperature (95 degrees C) microwave hydrolysis of bilberry presscake for industrial application. With this preliminary study, it is believed microwave hydrolysis offers an efficient and green approach to convert bilberry presscake into value-added products for food industry and biorefinery.

AB The aim of this study was to evaluate parents' experiences and responses to a systematic intervention for psychological preparation of children and families during the child's radiotherapy (RT) treatment. In this case-control study at 3 pediatric RT centers, an intervention with a preparatory kit, including age-adjusted information on tablets, gift of a stuffed toy or a pair of headphones, a parent booklet, and toy models of the computed tomography and RT machines was implemented. For evaluation, a mixed methods data collection was conducted. A total of 113 parents of children undergoing RT were includedn = 59 in the baseline group and n = 54 in the intervention group. Health-related quality of life was rated low, but parents in the intervention group expressed less anxiety after the RT compared with the baseline group. They found information suitable for their young children, siblings, and friends were involved and the toy models were used for play. Parents expressed positive feelings due to close interaction with staff and each other within the family. The solutions developed within a human-centered design approach and shaped as a systematic family-centered strategy contributed to parents understanding and coping with the child's RT.

AB Species invasions are an ever-growing problem that increases with globalization through increased frequency of unintentional introductions. Between establishment and spread, a lag phase often occurs in which population growth is exponential and dispersal frequency low. Individual variation in behavioral traits, consistent through time and context, have been found crucial for understanding ecological processes such as density dependent dispersal during species invasions. In a previous study of the invasive round goby (Neogobius melanostomus), we found population differentiation between old and new populations in the Baltic Sea with individuals in new populations being more asocial, bold, and active. Here, we investigate if behavioral differentiations are created already during the initial spread from newly established populations. Hence, we monitored population growth and subsequent small-scale spread (< 800 m) in two newly invaded areas, as well as the behavioral traits previously connected to dispersal, over two successional seasons. We found phenotypic differentiation between dispersing and resident individuals with small-scale dispersers being smaller and more asocial. In addition, our catch-per-unit-effort data suggest a lag-phase of 3-5 yr, following initial colonization, before the round goby start spreading into the surrounding environment. This suggests that, at least in species that grow to high densities fast, sociability is more important than boldness and activity for triggering density-dependent dispersal.

AB In this paper, an integrated fractionation with a switchable ionic liquid (SIL), pulp hydrolysis, and lactic acid fermentation is carried out. For this, SO2-swithced SIL is used for fractionation of sugar cane (Saccharum officinarum) bagasse and giant cane (Arundo donax, AD). SIL is able to extract approximate to 2/3 of lignin when relatively large wood chips (approximate to 4 mm) are used without any mechanical agitation and just 1 h of treatment time for AD. Furthermore, SIL reuse is successfully demonstrated for four runs. Subsequently, the produced pulps are hydrolyzed within 15 min in a microwave reactor, producing a glucose rich hydrolysates. Finally, these hydrolysates are used as a carbohydrate source for Lactobacillus delbrueckii fermentation, which selectively transform all glucose present into optically pure D-lactic acid. Hence, the whole chain for lactic acid production from biomass is successfully demonstrated.

AB Non-small cell lung cancer is the most common type of lung cancer. Both environmental and genetic risk factors contribute to lung carcinogenesis. We conducted a genome-wide interaction analysis between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and smoking status (never-versus ever-smokers) in a European-descent population. We adopted a two-step analysis strategy in the discovery stage: we first conducted a case-only interaction analysis to assess the relationship between SNPs and smoking behavior using 13 336 non-small cell lung cancer cases. Candidate SNPs with P-value <0.001 were further analyzed using a standard case-control interaction analysis including 13 970 controls. The significant SNPs with P-value <3.5 x 10(-5) (correcting for multiple tests) from the case-control analysis in the discovery stage were further validated using an independent replication dataset comprising 5377 controls and 3054 non-small cell lung cancer cases. We further stratified the analysis by histological subtypes. Two novel SNPs, rs6441286 and rs17723637, were identified for overall lung cancer risk. The interaction odds ratio and meta-analysis P-value for these two SNPs were 1.24 with 6.96 x 10(-7) and 1.37 with 3.49 x 10(-7), respectively. In addition, interaction of smoking with rs4751674 was identified in squamous cell lung carcinoma with an odds ratio of 0.58 and P-value of 8.12 x 10(-7). This study is by far the largest genome-wide SNP-smoking interaction analysis reported for lung cancer. The three identified novel SNPs provide potential candidate biomarkers for lung cancer risk screening and intervention. The results from our study reinforce that gene-smoking interactions play important roles in the etiology of lung cancer and account for part of the missing heritability of this disease.

AB The functional organization of the frontal cortex is dynamic. Age-related increases in frontal functional responses have been shown during various cognitive tasks, but the cross-sectional nature of most past studies makes it unclear whether these increases reflect reorganization or stable individual differences. Here, we followed 130 older individuals' cognitive trajectories over 20-25 years with repeated neuropsychological assessments every 5th year, and identified individuals with stable or declining episodic memory. Both groups displayed significant gray matter atrophy over 2 successive magnetic resonance imaging sessions 4 years apart, but the decline group also had a smaller volume of the right hippocampus. Only individuals with declining memory demonstrated increased prefrontal functional responses during memory encoding and retrieval over the 4-year interval. Regions with increased functional recruitment were located outside, or on the borders of core task-related networks, indicating an expansion of these over time. These longitudinal findings offer novel insight into the mechanisms behind age-associated memory loss, and are consistent with a theoretical model in which hippocampus atrophy, past a critical threshold, induces episodic-memory decline and altered prefrontal functional organization.

AB Recent uses for rumen boluses, such as mortality implant transmitters (MITs), in wildlife have made it necessary to adapt deployment techniques developed for livestock. In 29 and 30 attempts to place MITs in Minnesota free-ranging moose (Alces alces) in 2013 and 2014, respectively, success was achieved 83% and 63% of the time. In 2014, new methods for MIT deployment were evaluated in captive moose in Alaska. Mandible measurements provided guidance for selection of an appropriate-sized bolus applicator. A Schulze mouth gag was used to aid insertion of the applicator, and canola oil was used to lubricate the bolus to facilitate swallowing. Time to first swallow and time to continuous swallow following sedative reversal was measured to gauge appropriate timing for bolus administration. Using the adapted technique with trained personnel, success rates for MIT deployment were 100% (10/10) for captive moose and 88% (21/24) for free-ranging moose in Minnesota in 2015.

TI Stable Accumulation of Photosystem II Requires ONE-HELIX PROTEIN1 (OHP1)

AB The cellular functions of two Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) one-helix proteins, OHP1 and OHP2 (also named LIGH-THARVESTING-LIKE2 [LIL2] and LIL6, respectively, because they have sequence similarity to light-harvesting chlorophyll a/b-binding proteins), remain unclear. Tagged null mutants of OHP1 and OHP2 (ohp1 and ohp2) showed stunted growth with pale-green leaves on agar plates, and these mutants were unable to grow on soil. Leaf chlorophyll fluorescence and the composition of thylakoid membrane proteins revealed that ohp1 deletion substantially affected photosystem II (PSII) core protein function and led to reduced levels of photosystem I core proteins; however, it did not affect LHC accumulation. Transgenic ohp1 plants rescued with OHP1-HA or OHP1-Myc proteins developed a normal phenotype. Using these tagged OHP1 proteins in transgenic plants, we localized OHP1 to thylakoid membranes, where it formed protein complexes with both OHP2 and High Chlorophyll Fluorescence244 (HCF244). We also found PSII core proteins D1/D2, HCF136, and HCF173 and a few other plant-specific proteins associated with the OHP1/OHP2-HCF244 complex, suggesting that these complexes are early intermediates in PSII assembly. OHP1 interacted directly with HCF244 in the complex. Therefore, OHP1 and HCF244 play important roles in the stable accumulation of PSII.

TI Fine-Tuning of Photosynthesis Requires CURVATURE THYLAKOID1-Mediated

AB The thylakoid membrane system of higher plant chloroplasts consists of interconnected subdomains of appressed and nonappressed membrane bilayers, known as grana and stroma lamellae, respectively. CURVATURE THYLAKOID1 (CURT1) protein complexes mediate the shape of grana stacks in a dosage-dependent manner and facilitate membrane curvature at the grana margins, the interface between grana and stroma lamellae. Although grana stacks are highly conserved among land plants, the functional relevance of grana stacking remains unclear. Here, we show that inhibiting CURT1-mediated alteration of thylakoid ultrastructure in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) reduces photosynthetic efficiency and plant fitness under adverse, controlled, and natural light conditions. Plants that lack CURT1 show less adjustment of grana diameter, which compromises regulatory mechanisms like the photosystem II repair cycle and state transitions. Interestingly, CURT1A suffices to induce thylakoid membrane curvature in planta and thylakoid hyperbending in plants overexpressing CURT1A. We suggest that CURT1 oligomerization is regulated at the posttranslational level in a light-dependent fashion and that CURT1-mediated thylakoid plasticity plays an important role in fine-tuning photosynthesis and plant fitness during challenging growth conditions.

AB Heterozygous missense mutations in the N-terminal motor or coiled-coil domains of the kinesin family member 5A (KIF5A) gene cause monogenic spastic paraplegia (HSP10) and Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2 (CMT2). Moreover, heterozygous de novo frame-shift mutations in the C-terminal domain of KIF5A are associated with neonatal intractable myoclonus, a neurodevelopmental syndrome. These findings, together with the observation that many of the disease genes associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis disrupt cytoskeletal function and intracellular transport, led us to hypothesize that mutations in KIF5A are also a cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Using whole exome sequencing followed by rare variant analysis of 426 patients with familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and 6137 control subjects, we detected an enrichment of KIF5A splice-site mutations in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (2/426 compared to 0/6137 in controls; P = 4.2 x 10(-3)), both located in a hot-spot in the C-terminus of the protein and predicted to affect splicing exon 27. We additionally show co-segregation with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis of two canonical splice-site mutations in two families. Investigation of lymphoblast cell lines from patients with KIF5A splice-site mutations revealed the loss of mutant RNA expression and suggested haploinsufficiency as the most probable underlying molecular mechanism. Furthermore, mRNA sequencing of a rare non-synonymous missense mutation (predicting p. Arg1007Gly) located in the C-terminus of the protein shortly upstream of the splice donor of exon 27 revealed defective KIF5A pre-mRNA splicing in respective patient-derived cell lines owing to abrogation of the donor site. Finally, the non-synonymous single nucleotide variant rs113247976 (minor allele frequency = 1.00% in controls, n = 6137), also located in the C-terminal region [p.(Pro986Leu) in exon 26], was significantly enriched in familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients (minor allele frequency = 3.40%; P = 1.28 x 10(-7)). Our study demonstrates that mutations located specifically in a C-terminal hotspot of KIF5A can cause a classical amyotrophic lateral sclerosis phenotype, and underline the involvement of intracellular transport processes in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis pathogenesis.

AB Adults with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) do worse than children. From 7/2008 to 12/2014, Nordic and Baltic centers treated 1509 consecutive patients aged 1-45 years with Philadelphia chromosome-negative ALL according to the NOPHO ALL2008 without cranial irradiation. Overall, 1022 patients were of age 1-9 years (A), 266 were 10-17 years (B) and 221 were 18-45 years (C). Sixteen patients (three adults) died during induction. All others achieved remission after induction or 1-3 intensive blocks. Subsequently, 45 patients (12 adults) died, 122 patients relapsed (32 adults) with a median time to relapse of 1.6 years and 13 (no adult) developed a second malignancy. Median follow-up time was 4.6 years. Among the three age groups, older patients more often had higher risk ALL due to T-ALL (32%/25%/9%, P<0.001), KMT2A rearrangements (6%/5%/3%, P<0.001) and higher day 29 residual leukemia for B-lineage (P<0.001), but not T-ALL (P = 0.53). Event-free survival rates (pEFS(5y)) were 89 +/- 1% (A), 80 +/- 3% (B) and 74 +/- 4% (C) with significant differences only for non-high risk groups. Except for thrombosis, pancreatitis and osteonecrosis, the risk of 19 specified toxicities was not enhanced by age above 10 years. In conclusion, a pediatric-based protocol is tolerable and effective for young adults, despite their increased frequency of higher risk features.

AB Global warming and land use scenarios suggest increased 21st century nitrogen (N) inputs to aquatic systems. Nitrogen affects in-lake processing and, potentially, atmospheric exchange of greenhouse gases, probably being most relevant in unproductive systems. Here, we test for the first time the effect of a whole-lake experimental increase (threefold) in external nitrate loads on the atmospheric exchange of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) from N-limited unproductive boreal lakes. Nitrate enrichment effects were assessed within a paired Before/After-Control/Impact framework based on 2-hourly to biweekly surface-water sampling of dissolved gas concentrations, and monthly whole-lake inventory surveys, carried out over 4 yrs in six lakes. Nitrate enrichment did not affect gas exchange during summer stratification and whole-lake gas inventories during summer and winter stratification. This finding specifically emphasizes the modest role of internal carbon fixation for the CO2 dynamics of unproductive boreal lakes. A global synthesis of 52 published studies revealed a wide range of nutrient fertilization effects, both in systems similar to our experimental lakes, and other more productive systems. Effects depended mainly on the spatiotemporal scale of the study and became more pronounced when N enrichment was combined with phosphorous. Conclusively, although short-term and habitat-specific effects can occur, changes in N supply have only weak whole-ecosystem effects on greenhouse gas emissions from unproductive boreal lakes.

AB Neurotoxic methylmercury causes adverse effects to ecosystem viability and human health. Previous studies have revealed that ponding alters natural organic matter (NOM) composition and increase methylmercury concentrations in rivers, especially in the first years after flooding. Here, we investigate the influence of NOM composition (i.e., sources and degradation status) on mercury methylation rate constants in nine boreal beaver ponds of different ages across Sweden. We show that increased methylmercury concentrations in surface waters is a consequence of enhanced mercury methylation in the pond sediments. Moreover, our results reveal that during the first years after the initial flooding, mercury methylation rates are fueled by the amount of fresh humic substances released from the flooded soils and by an increased production of algal-derived NOM triggered by enhanced nutrient availability. Our findings indicate that impoundment-induced changes in NOM composition control mercury methylation processes, causing the raise in MeHg levels in ponds.

AB Genome-wide association analysis advanced understanding of blood pressure (BP), a major risk factor for vascular conditions such as coronary heart disease and stroke. Accounting for smoking behavior may help identify BP loci and extend our knowledge of its genetic architecture. We performed genome-wide association meta-analyses of systolic and diastolic BP incorporating gene-smoking interactions in 610,091 individuals. Stage 1 analysis examined similar to 18.8 million SNPs and small insertion/deletion variants in 129,913 individuals from four ancestries (European, African, Asian, and Hispanic) with follow-up analysis of promising variants in 480,178 additional individuals from five ancestries. We identified 15 loci that were genome-wide significant (p < 5 x 10(-8)) in stage 1 and formally replicated in stage 2. A combined stage 1 and 2 meta-analysis identified 66 additional genome-wide significant loci (13, 35, and 18 loci in European, African, and trans-ancestry, respectively). A total of 56 known BP loci were also identified by our results (p < 5 x 10(-8)). Of the newly identified loci, ten showed significant interaction with smoking status, but none of them were replicated in stage 2. Several loci were identified in African ancestry, highlighting the importance of genetic studies in diverse populations. The identified loci show strong evidence for regulatory features and support shared pathophysiology with cardiometabolic and addiction traits. They also highlight a role in BP regulation for biological candidates such as modulators of vascular structure and function (CDKN1B, BCAR1-CFDP1, PXDN, EEA1), ciliopathies (SDCCAG8, RPGRIP1L), telomere maintenance (TNKS, PINX1, AKTIP), and central dopaminergic signaling MSRA, EBF2).

AB In order to better understand the context of suffering from dementia disorders, greater efforts should be made to understand and identify what persons with such disorders experience when living in a nursing home. The aim of this qualitative study was to gain further understanding of how persons with dementia disorders experienced and coped with their changed life situation after being relocated to a nursing home as described by their family members' perceptions. Qualitative data were collected from ten interviews with family members and evaluated using content analysis. The main findings suggest that residents with dementia disorders largely maintained their personality intact throughout the trajectory of illness as they were able to keep their habits and interests. The local environment of the nursing home and the residents' relationships to staff were important in order to feel accepted. Four categories were discerned during the analysis: living in limbo; coming to peace; keeping old habits and relationships; and thoughts about impending death. It is reasonable to believe that old habits and interests may be preserved as the embodiment of such habits are deeply rooted and connected to a persons identity even when going through various changes and transitions in life. Therefore, to be accepted as the person you are requires care and services to specific needs, i.e. person-centeredness. Lack of understanding from staff may therefore have an adverse effect on a person's self-respect and identity. For that reason, staff needs to reflect on their attitudes and relationships as well as extending their knowledge about how to address sensitive topics such as the residents impending death. To achieve this support from managers is pivotal. Future research should focus on support to nursing staff to further knowledge and understanding about the individual changes resident go through near the end of life.

AB BackgroundResidential care homes (RCHs) play an important role in end-of-life care, being the most common place of death for elderly people in several European countries. Care pathways such as the Liverpool Care Pathway for the Dying Patient (LCP) are used to improve and ensure quality care at the end of life. There is a lack of scientific evidence supporting the use of care pathways.
   DesignA descriptive qualitative study.
   ObjectiveThe aim was to describe care professionals' experiences of using the Liverpool Care Pathway for the Dying Patient in the care of dying residents in residential care homes.
   MethodsFive focus group interviews and two individual interviews with enrolled nurses (n = 10), Registered Nurses (n = 9) and general practitioners (n = 5) were carried out and analysed using qualitative content analysis.
   ResultsCare professionals expressed that they became confident through a shared approach to care, were supported to tailor the care according to the residents' individual needs, were supported to involve family members in decision-making and care and became more aware of the care environment.
   ConclusionThe results of this study indicate that the LCP might be a useful tool for care professionals in improving end-of-life care in RCHs through increased attention to the goals of care, the individual needs of residents and family involvement.

AB BackgroundThe complex needs of people with chronic heart failure (HF) place great demands on their family members, and it is important to ask family members about their perspectives on the quality of HF care.
   ObjectiveTo describe family members' perceptions of quality of HF care in an outpatient setting.
   MethodsA cross-sectional study using a short form of the Quality from Patients' Perspective (QPP) questionnaire for data collection. The items in the questionnaire measure four dimensions of quality, and each item consists of both the perceived reality of the care and its subjective importance. The study included 57 family members of patients with severe HF in NYHA class III-IV.
   ResultsFamily members reported areas for quality improvements in three out of four dimensions and in dimensionless items. The lowest level of perceived reality was reported for treatment for confusion and loss of appetite. Treatment for shortness of breath, access to the apparatus and access to equipment necessary for medical care were the items with the highest subjective importance for the family members.
   ConclusionFamily members identified important areas for quality improvement in the care for patients with HF in an outpatient setting. In particular, symptom alleviation, information to patients, patient participation and access to care were identified as areas for improvements. Thus, measuring quality from the family members' perspective with the QPP might be a useful additional perspective when it comes to the planning and implementation of changes in the organisation of HF care.

AB IntroductionA feature of the healthcare system in Sweden, particularly in the care of older people, is its cultural diversity in terms of having considerable numbers of both caregivers and care recipients with an immigrant background. Considering the influence of culture in ethical decision-making processes, the idea of conscience and the adverse effects of a troubled conscience, it is important to study the concepts of conscience and troubled conscience in culturally diverse populations. There is no published study regarding troubled conscience among immigrant populations that includes enrolled nurses.
   AimTo illuminate the meanings of troubled conscience and how to deal with it among enrolled nurses with Iranian backgrounds working in Swedish residential care for Persian-speaking people with dementia who have emigrated from Iran.
   MethodThe study was conducted with a phenomenological hermeneutic design. Ten enrolled nurses with an Iranian background, with at least one year's experience of taking care of older people with dementia, were interviewed. The study was reviewed by the Regional Ethical Review Board for ethical vetting of research involving humans. Appropriate measures were taken to ensure confidentiality and voluntary participation.
   ResultsThe meanings of having a troubled conscience for the participants comprise not being a good person, including being an uncaring person, not acting according to one's values and living in a state of unease. Dealing with a troubled conscience involves trying to compensate for the harm one has caused and trying to prevent similar situations by being a responsible caregiver.
   ConclusionsThe enrolled nurses understood themselves as caring people and not only caregivers. They knew that they should hear their conscience and respond to it by trying to be a caring person and acting according to their values. The findings should be interpreted in the given specific context.

AB BackgroundNegative aspects, staff dissatisfaction and problems related to internal organisational factors of working in elderly care are well-known and documented. Much less is known about positive aspects of working in elderly care, and therefore, this study focuses on such positive factors in Swedish elderly care. We combined two theoretical models, the effort-reward imbalance model and the Transformational Leadership Style model. The aim was to estimate the potential associations between employee-perceived transformational leadership style of their managers, and employees' ratings of effort and reward within elderly care work.
   MethodsThe article is based on questionnaires distributed at on-site visits to registered nurses, occupational therapists, physiotherapists (high-level education) and assistant nurses (low-level education) in nine Swedish elderly care facilities. In order to grasp the positive factors of work in elderly care, we focused on balance at work, rather than imbalance.
   ResultsWe found a significant association between employees' effort-reward balance at work and a transformational leadership style among managers. An association was also found between employees' level of education and their assessments of the first-level managers.
   ConclusionsWe conclude that the first-level manager is an important actor for achieving a good workplace within elderly care, since she/he influences employees' psychosocial working environment. We also conclude that there are differences and inequalities, in terms of well-being, effort and reward at the work place, between those with academic training and those without, in that the former group to a higher degree evaluated their first-level manager to perform a transformational leadership style, which in turn is beneficial for their psychosocial work environment. Consequently, this (re)-produce inequalities in terms of well-being, effort and reward among the employees at the work place.

AB Background and AimQRS amplitude and duration are associated with increased left ventricular (LV) volume, mass and dysfunction. However, the diagnostic concordance between QRS measurements and LV morphology and function, as shown by Doppler echocardiography, is not well established. We investigated the relationships of QRS duration and amplitude with echocardiographic measurements of LV morphology and systolic and diastolic function in normal individuals.
   MethodsIndividuals without signs or symptoms of coronary artery disease or heart failure, who underwent clinical examination as a part of a cross-sectional survey for the prevalence of coronary risk factors, randomly selected from the population list in Caltanissetta, Italy, were included in the study. QRS duration and amplitude were automatically measured using inbuilt software. LV ejection and filling patterns were studied using Doppler echocardiography.
   ResultsWe studied 184 individuals (96 men and 88 women), mean age 55.9 (11.3). QRS duration increased by 5.4ms for every 100g increase in LV mass, and by 4.6ms for each 10mm increase in LV end-diastolic diameter. The amplitude increased by 0.8mm for every 100g increase in LV mass. There was no relationship with LV dimensions. A nonlinear correlation was found between QRS amplitude and indexes of global dyssynchrony. The time-voltage QRS area correlated with LV mass, dimensions and indexes of dyssynchrony. There was no relationship between QRS measurements and ejection fraction.
   ConclusionsQRS prolongation and increase in amplitude are strongly influenced by LV increased mass and volume, as well as by dyssynchrony, independently of ejection fraction.

This study aims to evaluate whether benthic macroinvertebrate communities responded to an expanded set of stream restoration measures within a study period of one to five years after completion of the restoration project. We studied 10 forest streams in northern Sweden that were channelized in the past for timber floating. Managers subjected six of these streams to habitat restoration, on each of these we selected two reaches, located in close proximity but differing in restoration intensity. In basic restored reaches, the restoration managers broke up the channelized banks and returned cobbles and small boulders to the main channel. In enhanced restoration reaches, they added additional large wood and boulders to reaches previously subjected to basic restoration, and rehabilitated gravel beds. The remaining four streams were not restored, and thus represent the baseline impacted (channelized) condition. We surveyed stream benthic assemblages before the enhanced restoration (year 2010) and three times afterward between 2011 and 2015. Five years after restoration, macroinvertebrate assemblages at the enhanced restored reaches were more differentiated from channelized conditions than those at basic-restored reaches. This reflected increased relative abundances of the insect orders Ephemeroptera and Trichoptera and the bivalve molluscs Sphaeriidae and decreased relative abundances of Chironomidae (Diptera). Analysis of functional traits provided further insights on the mechanistic explanations driving the recovery, e.g., indicating that the augmented channel retention capacity at enhanced restored reaches favored taxa adapted to slow flow conditions and more effectively retained passive aquatic dispersers. The increased restoration intensity in enhanced restored reaches has resulted in shifts in the composition of benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages, including increases in more sensitive taxa. These shifts became fully apparent five years after the enhanced restoration. Our results emphasize the value of longer-term monitoring to assess ecological responses following restoration, and of undertaking additional restoration as a valuable management option for previously restored sites that failed to achieve biotic recovery.

AB The boreal ecoregion supports about one-third of the world's forest. Over 90% of boreal forest streams are found in headwaters, where terrestrial-aquatic interfaces are dominated by organic matter (OM)-rich riparian zones (RZs). Because these transition zones are key features controlling catchment biogeochemistry, appropriate RZ conceptualizations are needed to sustainably manage surface water quality in the face of a changing climate and increased demands for forest biomass. Here we present a simple, yet comprehensive, conceptualization of RZ function based on hydrological connectivity, biogeochemical processes, and spatial heterogeneity. We consider four dimensions of hydrological connectivity: (1) laterally along hillslopes, (2) longitudinally along the stream, (3) vertically down the riparian profile, and (4) temporally through event-based and seasonal changes in hydrology. Of particular importance is the vertical dimension, characterized by a 'Dominant Source Layer' that has the highest contribution to solute and water fluxes to streams. In addition to serving as the primary source of OM to boreal streams, RZs shape water chemistry through two sets of OM-dependent biogeochemical processes: (1) transport and retention of OM-associated material and (2) redox-mediated transformations controlled by RZ water residence time and availability of labile OM. These processes can lead to both retention and release of pollutants. Variations in width, hydrological connectivity, and OM storage drive spatial heterogeneity in RZ biogeochemical function. This conceptualization provides a useful theoretical framework for environmental scientists and ecologically sustainable and economically effective forest management in the boreal region and elsewhere, where forest headwaters are dominated by low-gradient, OM-rich RZs.

AB The knowledge of the development of comorbidities in patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is limited. The aim of this study was to analyse associations between AS disease characteristics and comorbidity and to evaluate patterns of comorbidities in patients with AS. Patients with AS, fulfilling the modified New York Criteria, were identified (n = 346, mean age 56 +/- 15 years, 75% men, 99% HLA B27 positive). Through a review of the patient records, data on disease activity parameters, laboratory results, disease manifestations, and diagnoses of any clinically significant comorbidity was obtained. Four categories of comorbidities of interest were identified: A. arrhythmias, conduction disorders, and valvular heart disease; B. atherosclerosis and atherosclerotic CVD; C. spinal and non-spinal fractures; and D. obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome. Associations between AS disease characteristics and comorbidities in categories were assessed in logistic regression models. Differences in proportions of comorbidities was analysed using two-sided chi-square. Age was associated with all four categories of comorbidities, and male sex with arrhythmias, conduction disorders, valvular heart disease, and obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome. Early disease onset and long disease duration, respectively, were associated with arrhythmias, conduction disorders, and valvular heart disease. Obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome was associated with features of the metabolic syndrome. Patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease had an increased risk of most other comorbidities, similar to, but more pronounced than patients with arrhythmias, conduction disorders and valvular heart disease. Comorbid conditions motivate clinical awareness among patients with AS. Longitudinal studies are needed to establish preventive measures.

AB Fatalities caused by animal attacks are rare, but have the potential to mimic homicide. We present a case in which a moose attacked and killed a woman who was walking her dog in a forest. Autopsy showed widespread blunt trauma with a large laceration on one leg in which blades of grass were embedded. Flail chest was the cause of death. The case was initially conceived as homicide by means of a riding lawn mower. A review of the case by moose experts and analyses of biological trace material that proved to originate from moose, established the true source of injury. The dog probably provoked a moose, which, in response, stomped and gored the victim to death. The injuries resembled those previously reported from attacks by cattle and water buffalo. Fatal moose attacks constitute an extremely rare threat in boreal areas, but can be considered in traumatic deaths of unknown cause.

AB The influence of operating condition on particle formation during pressurized, oxygen blown gasification of wood powder with an ash content of 0.4 wt% was investigated. The investigation was performed with a pilot scale gasifier operated at 7 bar(a). Two loads, 400 and 600 kW were tested, with the oxygen equivalence ratio (A) varied between 0.25 and 0.50. Particle concentration and mass size distribution was analyzed with a low pressure cascade impactor and the collected particles were characterized for morphology, elemental composition, nanostructure, and reactivity using scanning electron microscopy/high resolution transmission electron microscopy energy dispersive spectroscopy, and thermogravimetric analysis. In order to quantify the nanostructure of the particles and identify prevalent sub-structures, a novel image analysis framework was used. It was found that the process temperature, affected both by A and the load of the gasifier, had a significant influence on the particle formation processes. At low temperature (1060 degrees C), the formed soot particles seemed to be resistant to the oxidation process; however, when the oxidation process started at 1119 degrees C, the internal burning of the more reactive particle core began. A further increase in temperature ( > 1313 degrees C) lead to the oxidation of the less reactive particle shell. When the shell finally collapsed due to severe oxidation, the original soot particle shape and nanostructure also disappeared and the resulting particle could not be considered as a soot anymore. Instead, the particle shape and nanostructure at the highest temperatures ( > 1430 degrees C) were a function of the inorganic content and of the inorganic elements the individual particle consisted of. All of these effects together lead to the soot particles in the real gasifier environment having less and less ordered nanostructure and higher and higher reactivity as the temperature increased; i.e., they followed the opposite trend of what is observed during laboratory-scale studies with fuels not containing any ash-forming elements and where the temperature was not controlled by A.

AB The Western Siberian Lowlands (WSL) store large quantities of organic carbon that will be exposed and mobilized by the thawing of permafrost. The fate of mobilized carbon, however, is not well understood, partly because of inadequate knowledge of hydrological controls in the region which has a vast low-relief surface area, extensive lake and wetland coverage and gradually increasing permafrost influence. We used stable water isotopes to improve our understanding of dominant landscape controls on the hydrology of the WSL. We sampled rivers along a 1700 km South-North transect from permafrost-free to continuous permafrost repeatedly over three years, and derived isotope proxies for catchment hydrological responsiveness and connectivity. We found correlations between the isotope proxies and catchment characteristics, suggesting that lakes and wetlands are intimately connected to rivers, and that permafrost increases the responsiveness of the catchment to rainfall and snowmelt events, reducing catchment mean transit times. Our work provides rare isotope-based field evidence that permafrost and lakes/wetlands influence hydrological pathways across a wide range of spatial scales (10-10(5) km(2)) and permafrost coverage (0%-70%). This has important implications, because both permafrost extent and lake/wetland coverage are affected by permafrost thaw in the changing climate. Changes in these hydrological landscape controls are likely to alter carbon export and emission via inland waters, which may be of global significance.

AB Burnout is a construct that has garnered considerable attention in sport psychology within recent years. Several hypothesized models regarding how the three dimensions (exhaustion, devaluation, and reduced sense of accomplishment) temporally relate to each other have been advanced. One proposal outlined by Maslach and Leiter suggests that exhaustion predicts devaluation which predicts reduced sense of accomplishment. However, there is no consensus among researchers as it has been argued that exhaustion predicts devaluation and reduced accomplishment separately. The aim of this study was to test multiple alternative hypotheses regarding the relationships of the burnout dimensions in athletes. Two samples of Swedish youth elite athletes with differing time spans between measurements were used. Specifically, one sample involved time-intensive measures collected every week over an eight-week period, and the other sample included four measurement points across an 18-month period. Results showed that none of the previously proposed models outlining the temporal relations of burnout dimensions were supported. Statistical analysis of the models including the cross-lagged predictions of dimensions did not have any statistically significant impact except when exhaustion negatively predicted devaluation between time 1 (month 0) and time 2 (month 6) in the 18-month sample; this relation faded in the following time points. Further, issues regarding the stability of devaluation and reduced sense of accomplishment emerged as their autocorrelation were very weak in the time-intensive sample. These findings raise a number of points for further theoretical and practical discussions about the athlete burnout construct.

AB Middle Eastern immigrants to western countries are at high risk of developing type 2 diabetes. However, the heritability and impact of first-degree family history (FH) of type 2 diabetes on insulin secretion and action have not been adequately described.
   Citizens of Malmo, Sweden, aged 30-75 years born in Iraq or Sweden were invited to participate in this population-based study. Insulin secretion (corrected insulin response and oral disposition index) and action (insulin sensitivity index) were assessed by oral glucose tolerance tests.
   In total, 45.7% of Iraqis (616/1348) and 27.4% of native Swedes (201/733) had FH in parent(s), sibling(s) or single parent and sibling, i.e., FH+. Approximately 8% of Iraqis and 0.7% of Swedes had ae<yen> 3 sibling(s) and parent(s) with diabetes, i.e., FH++. Irrespective of family size, prediabetes and diabetes increased with family burden (FH- 29.4%; FH+ 38.8%; FH++ 61.7%) without significant differences across ethnicities. With increasing level of family burden, insulin secretion rather than insulin action decreased. Individuals with a combination of ae<yen> 3 siblings and parents with diabetes presented with the lowest levels of insulin secretion.
   The Iraqi immigrant population often present with a strong familial burden of type 2 diabetes with the worst glycemic control and highest diabetes risk in individuals with ae<yen> 3 siblings and parents with diabetes. Our data show that in a population still free from diabetes familial burden influences insulin secretion to a higher degree than insulin action and may be a logical target for intervention.

AB Recent interest in intracranial pressure (ICP) in the upright posture has revealed that the mechanisms regulating postural changes in ICP are not fully understood. We have suggested an explanatory model where the postural changes in ICP depend on well-established hydrostatic effects in the venous system and where these effects are interrupted by collapse of the internal jugular veins (IJVs) in more upright positions. The aim of this study was to investigate this relationship by simultaneous invasive measurements of ICP, venous pressure, and IJV collapse in healthy volunteers. ICP (monitored via the lumbar route), central venous pressure (peripherally inserted central catheter line), and IJV cross-sectional area (ultrasound) were measured in 11 healthy volunteers (47 +/- 10 yr, mean +/- SD) in 7 positions, from supine to sitting (0-69 degrees). Venous pressure and anatomical distances were used to predict ICP in accordance with the explanatory model, and IJV area was used to assess IJV collapse. The hypothesis was tested by comparing measured ICP with predicted ICP. Our model accurately described the general behavior of the observed postural ICP changes (mean difference, -0.03 +/- 2.7 mmHg). No difference was found between predicted and measured ICP for any tilt angle (P values, 0.65-0.94). The results support the hypothesis that postural ICP changes are governed by hydrostatic effects in the venous system and IJV collapse. This improved understanding of postural ICP regulation may have important implications for the development of better treatments for neurological and neurosurgical conditions affecting ICP.

ID AGREEMENT; COEFFICIENT
AB Interrater agreement on binary measurements with more than two raters is often assessed using Fleiss' , which is known to be difficult to interpret. In situations where the same raters rate all items, however, the far less known suggested by Conger, Hubert, and Schouten is more appropriate. We try to support the interpretation of these characteristics by investigating various models or scenarios of rating. Our analysis, which is restricted to binary data, shows that conclusions concerning interrater agreement by heavily depend on the population of items or subjects considered, even if the raters have identical behavior. The standard scale proposed by Landis and Koch, which verbally interprets numerical values of , appears to be rather subjective. On the basis of one of the models for rater behavior, we suggest an alternative verbal interpretation for kappa. Finally, we reconsider a classical example from pathology to illustrate the application of our methods and models. We also look for subgroups of raters with similar rating behavior using hierarchical clustering.

AB The aim of this study was to assess the link between elite athletes' motivational profiles and burnout using a person-centered approach. Participants were 391 Spanish elite athletes (201 males and 190 females), aged 16-30 years who completed questionnaires measuring demographic information, self-determined motivation, and athlete burnout. Latent profile analysis resulted in a five profile solution labeled: amotivation (Class 1), low motivation (Class 2), moderately autonomous motivation (Class 3), amotivated and moderately controlled motivation (Class 4), and highly motivated (Class 5). While no significant differences were found in emotional/physical exhaustion, Class 4 (amotivated and moderately controlled motivation) scored higher than classes 2 (low motivation), 3 (moderately autonomous motivation), and 5 (highly motivated) on a Reduced sense of Accomplishment and Sport Devaluation. Findings are discussed in relation to Self-Determination Theory, suggesting that the quality of one's motivation may be equally, if not more important than the quantity of motivation in determining subsequent health, well-being, and performance outcomes.

AB Catchment science plays a critical role in the protection of water resources in the face of ongoing changes in climate, long-range transport of air pollutants, and land use. Addressing these challenges, however, requires improved understanding of how, when, and where changes in water quantity and quality occur within river networks. To reach these goals, we must recognize how different catchment features are organized to regulate surface chemistry at multiple scales, from processes controlling headwaters, to the downstream mixing of water from multiple landscape sources and deep aquifers. Here we synthesize 30-years of hydrological and biogeochemical research from the Krycklan catchment study (KCS) in northern Sweden to demonstrate the benefits of coupling long-term monitoring with multi-scale research to advance our understanding of catchment functioning across space and time. We show that the regulation of hydrological and biogeochemical patterns in the KCS can be decomposed into four, hierarchically structured landscape features that include: (1) transmissivity and reactivity of dominant source layers within riparian soils, (2) spatial arrangement of groundwater input zones that govern water and solute fluxes at reach- to segment-scales, (3) landscape scale heterogeneity (forests, mires, and lakes) that generates unique biogeochemical signals downstream, and (4) broad-scale mixing of surface streams with deep groundwater contributions. While this set of features are perhaps specific to the study region, analogous hierarchical controls are likely to be widespread. Resolving these scale dependent processes is important for predicting how, when, and where different environmental changes may influence patterns of surface water chemistry within river networks.

AB Ecosystem engineers substantially alter physical flow characteristics and shape a river's form and function. Because the recurrence interval of geomorphic processes and disturbances in rivers commonly match the temporal scale of plants' life cycles or alterations by animals, the resulting feedbacks are an important component of rivers. In this review, we focus on biota that directly or indirectly induce a physical change in rivers and cause positive feedbacks on the functioning of that organism. We provide an overview of how various ecosystem engineers affect rivers at different temporal and spatial scales and plot them on a conceptual gradient of river types. Various plants engineer the river environment through stabilizing sediment and reducing flow velocities, including macrophytes, woody plants, and algal mats and biofilms. Among animals that engineer, beaver that build dams cause substantial changes to river dynamics. In addition, benthic macroinvertebrates and mussels can stabilize sediment and reduce velocities, and aquatic and riparian grazers modulate the effect of plants. Humans are also considered river ecosystem engineers. Most of the ecosystem engineers reported in literature occur in rivers with low to intermediate relative stability, intermediate channel widths, and small to intermediate grain sizes. Ecosystem engineers that create positive biogeomorphic feedbacks are important to take into account when managing river systems, as many common invasive species are successful due to their engineering capabilities. River restoration can use ecosystem engineers to spur holistic recovery. Future research points towards examining ecosystem engineers on longer spatial and temporal scales and understanding the co-evolution of organisms and landforms through engineering.

AB Streptomyces spp. are a highly diverse group of bacteria most of which are soil-inhabiting saprophytes. A few are plant pathogens that produce a family of phytotoxins called thaxtomins and cause significant economic losses, e.g., by reducing the marketability of potato tubers (Solanum tuberosum). In northern Europe, S. scabies, S. turgidiscabies and S. europaeiscabiei are the most common plant pathogenic species. In this study, a Streptomyces strain isolated from a netted scab lesion on a tuber of potato cv. Bintje in northern Sweden was identified as S. turgidiscabies but was found to differ in the genomic region carrying genes required for thaxtomin biosynthesis. Our results showed that the strain did not produce thaxtomin but rather phytotoxin fridamycin E, which is an anthraquinone novel to plant pathogenic Streptomyces spp. Fridamycin E was shown to reduce or inhibit sprouting of potato microtubers in vitro.

AB Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a life-threatening condition, characterized by an imbalance of vasoactive substances and remodeling of pulmonary vasculature. Nitric oxide, formed from l-arginine, is essential for homeostasis and smooth muscle cell relaxation in PAH. Our aim was to compare plasma concentrations of l-arginine, asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), and symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA) in PAH compared to left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD) and healthy subjects. This was an observational, multicenter study comparing 21 patients with PAH to 14 patients with LVSD and 27 healthy subjects. Physical examinations were obtained and blood samples were collected. Plasma levels of ADMA, SDMA, l-arginine, l-ornithine, and l-citrulline were analyzed using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Plasma levels of ADMA and SDMA were higher, whereas l-arginine and l-arginine/ADMA ratio were lower in PAH patients compared to healthy subjects (p < 0.001). Patients with PAH also had lower levels of l-arginine than patients with LVSD (p < 0.05). l-Arginine correlated to 6 min walking distance (6MWD) (r (s) = 0.58, p = 0.006) and l-arginine/ADMA correlated to WHO functional class (r (s) = -0.46, p = 0.043) in PAH. In conclusion, l-arginine levels were significantly lower in treatment na < ve PAH patients compared to patients with LVSD. Furthermore, l-arginine correlated with 6MWD in PAH. l-arginine may provide useful information in differentiating PAH from LVSD.

AB Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) techniques are widely used for determination of long-lived radionuclides and their isotopic ratios in the nuclear fields. Uranium (U) and Plutonium (Pu) isotopes have been determined by many researchers with ICP-MS due to its relatively high sensitivity and short measurement time. In this work, an inter-laboratory comparison exercise among the Nordic countries was performed, focusing on the measurement of U and Pu isotopes in certified reference materials by ICP-MS. The performance and characters of different ICP-MS instruments are evaluated and discussed in this paper.

AB Platelets are involved in several steps of cancer metastasis. During this process, platelets are exposed to the tumor and its environment, thereby exchanging biomolecules with the tumor cells and resulting in tumor-mediated education of the platelets and a change in their RNA profile. Analysis of platelet RNA profiles or direct measurement of tumor-derived biomarkers within platelets can provide information on ongoing cancer-related processes in the individual (e.g., whether the patient has cancer, the tumor type, and possibly identify oncogenic alterations driving the disease for treatment selection). The close interaction with the disease process and the ability to respond to systemic alterations make platelets an interesting biosource for implementation in precision medicine.

AB This essay is a contribution to the historiography of Lennart von Post and the early development of quantitative pollen analysis. Based on von Post's own publications and source material from the archives of Stockholm University College, where he was appointed professor in 1929, the essay offers four points on von Post's scientific identity and the collective work through which quantitative pollen analysis, or "pollen statistics", came into being. The four points are, first, that von Post made his career as a geologist; second, that he framed pollen analysis as a means to tackle Quaternary geological issues; third, that his work benefitted from collective work, both in the field and in the laboratory; and fourth, that quantitative pollen analysis was not accepted without criticism, taking some years to break through beyond the Geological Survey, where von Post worked before he became professor.

AB IntroductionAnti-secretory factor is a protein that regulates secretory and inflammatory processes and preterm birth is associated with inflammation. Therefore, our hypothesis was that anti-secretory factor might play a role in immune reactivity and homeostasis during pregnancy.
   Material and methodsFollowing spontaneous onset of labor and preterm or term delivery, placenta biopsies were collected. The levels of anti-secretory factor and markers of inflammation (CD68, CD163) and vascularization (CD34, smooth muscle actin) were analyzed by immunohistochemistry.
   ResultsThe 61 placental biopsies included 31 preterm (<37 weeks of gestation) and 30 term (37-41 weeks) samples. The preterm placentas exhibited lower levels of anti-secretory factor (p = 0.008) and larger numbers of CD68-positive cells (p < 0.001) compared to term. Preterm placentas had blood vessel of smaller diameter (p = 0.036) indicative of immaturity. The level of interleukin-6 in cord blood was higher after very preterm than term birth, suggesting a fetal inflammatory response. The placenta level of anti-secretory factor was positively correlated to the length of gestation (p = 0.025) and negatively correlated to the levels of the inflammatory markers CD68 (p = 0.015) and CD163 (p = 0.028).
   ConclusionsPreterm delivery is associated with low levels of anti-secretory factor in placenta. Inflammation, a potential trigger of preterm birth, is more pronounced in the preterm placenta and inversely related to the placental level of anti-secretory factor, suggesting both a link and a potential target for intervention.

AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE
   CYP1B1 and CYP1A1 are important extra-hepatic cytochromes, expressed in the colon and involved in the metabolism of dietary constituents and exogenous compounds. CYP1B1 expression is increased by pro-inflammatory cytokines, and it has been recently implicated in regulation of blood brain barrier function. We investigated its involvement in the increased permeability of the intestinal epithelial barrier observed in inflammatory conditions.
   EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH
   Epithelial monolayers formed by human T84 colon carcinoma cells cultured on transwells, were disrupted by incubation with IFN gamma (10 ng.mL(-1)). Monolayer integrity was measured using transepithelial electrical resistance. CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 inhibitors or inducers were applied apically. Potential mechanisms of action were investigated using RT-qPCR.
   KEY RESULTS
   IFN gamma disrupts the barrier integrity of the T84 monolayers and increases CYP1B1 and HIF1 alpha mRNA expression. CYP1B1 induction is inhibited by the NF-kappa B inhibitor ammonium pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate (100 mu M) but not by the HIF1 alpha inhibitor 3-(5-hydroxymethyl-2-furyl)-1-benzyl indazole (50 mu M). Inhibition of CYP1B1 with the selective inhibitor 2,4,3,5-tetramethoxystilbene (100 nM) partly reverses the effects of IFN gamma on epithelial permeability.
   CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS
   These data suggest that increased expression of CYP1B1 is involved in the effects of IFN gamma on epithelial permeability. Inhibition of CYP1B1 counteracts the alterations of epithelial barrier integrity induced by IFN gamma and could thus have a therapeutic potential in disorders of intestinal permeability associated with inflammation.

AB In this work a Nitsche-based imposition of generalized Navier conditions on cut meshes for the Oseen problem is presented. Other methods from literature dealing with the generalized Navier condition impose this condition by means of substituting the tangential Robin condition in a classical Galerkin way. These methods work fine for a large slip length coefficient but lead to conditioning and stability issues when it approaches zero. We introduce a novel method for the weak imposition of the generalized Navier condition which remains well-posed and stable for arbitrary choice of slip length, including zero. The method proposed here builds on the formulation done by Juntunen and Stenberg (2009). They impose a Robin condition for the Poisson problem by means of Nitsche's method for an arbitrary combination of the Dirichlet and Neumann parts of the condition. The analysis conducted for the proposed method is done in a similar fashion as in Massing et al. (2018), but is done here for a more general type of boundary condition. The analysis proves stability for all flow regimes and all choices of slip lengths. Also an L-2-optimal estimate for the velocity error is shown, which was not conducted in the previously mentioned work. A numerical example is carried out for varying slip lengths to verify the robustness and stability of the method with respect to the choice of slip length. Even though proofs and formulations are presented for the more general case of an unfitted grid method, they can easily be reduced to the simpler case of a boundary-fitted grid with the removal of the ghost-penalty stabilization terms (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB Formation of hazardous gases during transport and storage of biomass for large-scale bioenergy production is an important safety concern. While off-gassing has been addressed in numerous studies for raw woody biomass, very few describe it in the context of biomass for bioenergy production pre-treated by thermal technologies such as steam explosion. Volatile Organic Components (VOCs) are expected to be altered by the treatment, but until now there is no research published on VOC profiles of steam exploded materials in industrial scale. In the present study, VOCs emitted from the products were evaluated by sampling from different production steps from steam explosion of softwood bark, and following the production chain including also pelletization. Off-gasses were actively sampled using Tenax TA absorbent and analyzed by GC MS. The VOC formation dependency of operation and storage conditions at different process steps was evaluated by multivariate statistical analysis. We showed that the different process steps along the production line was the main influencing factor for VOC off gassing amounts, with highest VOC levels directly after the steam explosion process. Treatment severity mainly altered the relative composition of VOC profiles with more terpenes emitted from milder treatment, whereas more severe treatment shifted VOCs composition to contain more furans, e.g. furfural. In summary, treatment by steam explosion leads to potentially problematic VOC off-gassing profiles from the material, and levels vary considerable along the production line. The findings are important from a fuel handling and working environment perspective.

AB Background. Epidemiological evidence on the association between ambient air pollution and brain tumor risk is sparse and inconsistent.
   Methods. In 12 cohorts from 6 European countries, individual estimates of annual mean air pollution levels at the baseline residence were estimated by standardized land-use regression models developed within the ESCAPE and TRANSPHORM projects: particulate matter (PM) <= 2.5, <= 10, and 2.5-10 mu m in diameter (PM 2.5, PM (10), and PMcoarse), PM(2.)5 absorbance, nitrogen oxides (NO2 and NOx) and elemental composition of PM. We estimated cohort-specific associations of air pollutant concentrations and traffic intensity with total, malignant, and nonmalignant brain tumor, in separate Cox regression models, adjusting for risk factors, and pooled cohort-specific estimates using random-effects meta-analyses.
   Results. Of 282 194 subjects from 12 cohorts, 466 developed malignant brain tumors during 12 years of follow-up. Six of the cohorts also had data on nonmalignant brain tumor, where among 106 786 subjects, 366 developed brain tumor: 176 nonmalignant and 190 malignant. We found a positive, statistically nonsignificant association between malignant brain tumor and PM2.5 absorbance (hazard ratio and 95% CI: 1.67; 0.89-3.14 per 10(-5)/m(3)), and weak positive or null associations with the other pollutants. Hazard ratio for PM 2.5 absorbance (1.01; 0.38-2.71 per 10(-5)/m(3)) and all other pollutants were lower for nonmalignant than for malignant brain tumors.
   Conclusion. We found suggestive evidence of an association between long-term exposure to PM2.5 absorbance indicating traffic-related air pollution and malignant brain tumors, and no association with overall or nonmalignant brain tumors.

AB Objective Tissue macrophages induce and perpetuate proinflammatory responses, thereby promoting metabolic and cardiovascular disease. Lipoprotein lipase (LpL), the rate-limiting enzyme in blood triglyceride catabolism, is expressed by macrophages in atherosclerotic plaques. We questioned whether LpL, which is also expressed in the bone marrow (BM), affects circulating white blood cells and BM proliferation and modulates macrophage retention within the artery.
   Approach and Results We characterized blood and tissue leukocytes and inflammatory molecules in transgenic LpL knockout mice rescued from lethal hypertriglyceridemia within 18 hours of life by muscle-specific LpL expression (MCKL0 mice). LpL-deficient mice had approximate to 40% reduction in blood white blood cell, neutrophils, and total and inflammatory monocytes (Ly6C/G(hi)). LpL deficiency also significantly decreased expression of BM macrophage-associated markers (F4/80 and TNF- [tumor necrosis factor ]), master transcription factors (PU.1 and C/EBP), and colony-stimulating factors (CSFs) and their receptors, which are required for monocyte and monocyte precursor proliferation and differentiation. As a result, differentiation of macrophages from BM-derived monocyte progenitors and monocytes was decreased in MCKL0 mice. Furthermore, although LpL deficiency was associated with reduced BM uptake and accumulation of triglyceride-rich particles and macrophage CSF-macrophage CSF receptor binding, triglyceride lipolysis products (eg, linoleic acid) stimulated expression of macrophage CSF and macrophage CSF receptor in BM-derived macrophage precursor cells. Arterial macrophage numbers decreased after heparin-mediated LpL cell dissociation and by genetic knockout of arterial LpL. Reconstitution of LpL-expressing BM replenished aortic macrophage density.
   Conclusions LpL regulates peripheral leukocyte levels and affects BM monocyte progenitor differentiation and aortic macrophage accumulation.

AB Purpose: To test the hypothesis that normal-tension glaucoma (NTG) is caused by an increased pressure difference across the lamina cribrosa (LC) related to a low intracranial pressure (ICP).
   Design: Prospective case-control study.
   Participants: Thirteen NTG patients (9 women; median 71 [range: 56-83] years) were recruited for investigation with the same protocol as 11 healthy volunteers (8 women; 47 [30-59] years). A larger control group (n = 51; 30 women; 68 [30-81] years) was used only for ICP comparison in supine position.
   Methods: ICP and intraocular pressure (IOP) were simultaneously measured in supine, sitting, and 9 degrees head-down tilt (HDT) positions. Trans-elamina cribrosa pressure difference (TLCPD) was calculated using ICP and IOP together with geometric distances estimated from magnetic resonance imaging to adjust for hydrostatic effects.
   Main Outcome Measures: ICP, IOP, and TLCPD in different body positions.
   Results: Between NTG patients and healthy volunteers, there were no differences in ICP, IOP, or TLCPD in supine, sitting, or HDT (P >= 0.11), except for IOP in HDT (P = 0.04). There was no correlation between visual field defect and TLCPD, IOP, or ICP and in any body position (P >= 0.39). Mean ICP in supine was 10.3 mmHg (SD = 2.7) in the NTG group (n = 13) and 11.3 (2.2) mmHg in the larger control group (n = 51) (P = 0.24).
   Conclusions: There was no evidence of reduced ICP in NTG patients as compared with healthy controls, either in supine or in upright position. Consequently, the hypothesis that NTG is caused by an elevated TLCPD from low ICP was not supported. (C) 2017 by the American Academy of Ophthalmology.

AB International coopetition has rarely been studied in relation to innovation. Further exploration of effects of international coopetition, i.e. the pursuit of simultaneous cooperation and competition, on a firm's innovation performance is especially important as such a relationship is challenging with a high propensity to fail. This observation formed the point of departure for this study, which aims to increase the understanding of the effects of international coopetition on firm innovativeness and how these effects are conditioned on the magnitude of the organizational adjustments a firm introduces. We use an unbalanced panel of 9839 firms that participated in four waves of the Swedish Community Innovation Survey between 2008 and 2014 as our empirical base. We illustrate that firms that cooperate with competitors internationally are more likely to exhibit higher propensity to introduce radical innovations, yet this effect is conditioned upon the magnitude of organizational adjustments. Overall, our study contributes to the understanding of the implications of international coopetition and what a firm needs to benefit from it.

AB The Antarctic Peninsula, a tundra biome dominated by lichens and bryophytes, is an ecozone undergoing rapid temperature shifts. Such changes may demand a high physiological plasticity of the local lichen species to maintain their role as key drivers in this pristine habitat. This study examines the response of net photosynthesis and respiration to increasing temperatures for three Antarctic lichen species with different ecological response amplitudes. We hypothesize that negative effects caused by increased temperatures can be mitigated by thermal acclimation of respiration and/or photosynthesis. The fully controlled growth chamber experiment simulated intermediate and extreme temperature increases over the time course of 6 weeks. Results showed that, in contrast to our hypothesis, none of the species was able to down-regulate temperature-driven respiratory losses through thermal acclimation of respiration. Instead, severe effects on photobiont vitality demonstrated that temperatures around 15 degrees C mark the upper limit for the two species restricted to the Antarctic, and when mycobiont demands exceeded the photobiont capacity they could not survive within the lichen thallus. In contrast, the widespread lichen species was able to recover its homoeostasis by rapidly increasing net photosynthesis. We conclude that to understand the complete lichen response, acclimation processes of both symbionts, the photo- and the mycobiont, have to be evaluated separately. As a result, we postulate that any acclimation processes in lichen are species-specific. This, together with the high degree of response variability and sensitivity to temperature in different species that co-occur spatially close, complicates any predictions regarding future community composition in the Antarctic. Nevertheless, our results suggest that species with a broad ecological amplitude may be favoured with on-going changes in temperature.

AB Background and purposeDespite the important role of imaging in diagnosing idiopathic normal-pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH), a structured overall assessment of radiological signs is still lacking. The purpose of this study was to construct a radiological scale, composed of morphological signs of iNPH, and compare it with clinical symptoms.
   MethodsIn this prospective, population-based study of iNPH, 168 individuals (93 females) [mean age 75 (range 66-92)years] underwent computed tomography of the brain and a neurological examination with assessment of clinical symptoms according to Hellstrom's iNPH scale. Two radiologists, blinded to clinical data, independently evaluated and measured eight radiological parameters, i.e. Evans' index, callosal angle, size of temporal horns, narrow high-convexity sulci, dilated Sylvian fissures, focally dilated sulci, peri-ventricular hypodensities and bulging of the lateral ventricular roof.
   ResultsIn a linear regression model, all parameters except ventricular roof bulging were significantly associated with clinical iNPH symptoms. The seven remaining parameters were summarized into a total iNPH Radscale score ranging from 0 to 12. There was a significant correlation (r=0.55, P<0.001) between the total iNPH Radscale score and clinical symptoms. The inter-rater agreement for the included radiological parameters was high (intraclass correlation, 0.74-0.97).
   ConclusionThe iNPH Radscale may become a valuable diagnostic screening tool, allowing a structured radiological assessment. A high iNPH Radscale score together with clinical symptoms should raise suspicion of iNPH, motivating further evaluation for shunt surgery.

AB Over the past 10 years, a number of safety measures for reducing firefighters' exposure to combustion particles have been introduced in Sweden. The most important measure was the reduction in the time firefighters wear suits and handle contaminated equipment after turn-outs involving smoke diving. This study was divided into two parts, those being to investigate the level of protection obtained by multiple garment layers and to assess exposure during a standardized smoke diving exercise. First, realistic work protection factors (WPFs) were calculated by comparing air concentrations of the full suite of gaseous and particle-bound polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) inside and outside structural ensembles, including jacket and thick base layer, during a tough fire extinguishing exercise using wood as the fuel. Second, during a standardized smoke diving exercise, exposure was assessed by measuring PAH skin deposition and levels of eight urinary PAH metabolites in 20 volunteer student firefighters before and after the exercise. The average WPF for the sum of 22 PAHs was 146 +/- 33 suggesting a relatively high protective capacity but also indicating a substantial enrichment of contaminants with a risk of prolonged dermal exposure. Accordingly, in the second exercise, the median levels of skin-deposited Sigma 14-PAHs and urinary 1-hydroxypyrene significantly increased 5-fold (21 to 99 ng/wipe) and 8-fold (0.14 to 1.1 mu mol mol-1 creatinine), respectively, post exposure. Among the PAH metabolites investigated, 1-hydroxypyrene proved to be the most useful indicator of exposure, with significantly elevated urinary levels at both 6 h and 20 h after the exercise and with the strongest correlation to dermal exposure. Metabolites from two-ring and three-ring PAHs were eliminated faster while levels of 3-hydroxy-benzo[a]pyrene did not meet the detection criteria. The results from correlation studies indicated that dermal uptake was a major route of exposure in accordance with previous findings. To summarize, this study shows that some of the newly adopted protective measures were correctly implemented, and should continue to be followed and be more widely adopted.

AB PurposeRetinopathy of prematurity (ROP) causes childhood blindness globally in prematurely born infants. Although increased levels of oxygen supply lead to increased survival and reduced frequency of cerebral palsy, increased incidence of ROP is reported.
   MethodsWith the help of a Swedish register for ROP, SWEDROP, national and regional incidences of ROP and frequencies of treatment were evaluated from 2008 to 2015 (n=5734), as well as before and after targets of provided oxygen changed from 85-89% to 91-95% in 2014.
   ResultsRetinopathy of prematurity (ROP) was found in 31.9% (1829/5734) of all infants with a gestational age (GA) of <31weeks at birth and 5.7% of the infants (329/5734) had been treated for ROP. Analyses of the national data revealed an increased incidence of ROP during the 8-year study period (p=0.003), but there was no significant increase in the frequency of treatment. There were significant differences between the seven health regions of Sweden, regarding both incidence of ROP and frequency of treatment (p<0.001). Comparison of regional data before and after the new oxygen targets revealed a significant increase in treated ROP in one region [OR: 2.24 (CI: 1.11-4.49), p=0.024] and a borderline increase in one other [OR: 3.08 (CI: 0.99-9.60), p=0.052].
   ConclusionThe Swedish national ROP register revealed an increased incidence of ROP during an 8-year period and significant regional differences regarding the incidence of ROP and frequency of treatment.

AB 1. Grassland diversity can support sustainable intensification of grassland production through increased yields, reduced inputs and limited weed invasion. We report the effects of diversity on weed suppression from 3 years of a 31-site continental-scale field experiment.
   2. At each site, 15 grassland communities comprising four monocultures and 11 four-species mixtures based on a wide range of species' proportions were sown at two densities and managed by cutting. Forage species were selected according to two crossed functional traits, "method of nitrogen acquisition" and "pattern of temporal development".
   3. Across sites, years and sown densities, annual weed biomass in mixtures and monocultures was 0.5 and 2.0 t DM ha(-1) (7% and 33% of total biomass respectively). Over 95% of mixtures had weed biomass lower than the average of monocultures, and in two-thirds of cases, lower than in the most suppressive monoculture (transgressive suppression). Suppression was significantly transgressive for 58% of site-years. Transgressive suppression by mixtures was maintained across years, independent of site productivity.
   4. Based on models, average weed biomass in mixture over the whole experiment was 52% less (95% confidence interval: 30%-75%) than in the most suppressive monoculture. Transgressive suppression of weed biomass was significant at each year across all mixtures and for each mixture.
   5. Weed biomass was consistently low across all mixtures and years and was in some cases significantly but not largely different from that in the equiproportional mixture. The average variability (standard deviation) of annual weed biomass within a site was much lower for mixtures (0.42) than for monocultures (1.77).
   6. Synthesis and applications. Weed invasion can be diminished through a combination of forage species selected for complementarity and persistence traits in systems designed to reduce reliance on fertiliser nitrogen. In this study, effects of diversity on weed suppression were consistently strong across mixtures varying widely in species' proportions and over time. The level of weed biomass did not vary greatly across mixtures varying widely in proportions of sown species. These diversity benefits in intensively managed grasslands are relevant for the sustainable intensification of -agriculture and, importantly, are achievable through practical farm-scale actions.

AB 1. Implementing multi-use forest management to account for both commercial and non-commercial ecosystem services is gaining increased global recognition. Despite its spatial extent, and great economic and ecological values, few studies have evaluated the boreal forest and its management to assess the potential for simultaneous delivery of a suite of ecosystem services.
   2. Using data from a Swedish long-term experiment, this study explores how biodiversity of the ground vegetation and potential delivery of multiple ecosystem services (timber production, carbon [C] storage and non-timber forest products) are influenced by two common silvicultural practices (thinning, fertilization and their interaction).
   3. Diversity (diversity indices and species richness) of the ground vegetation was higher in thinned than in unthinned forest, a result attributable in part to six species of lichens that only occurred in thinned forest. In addition, supply of lichens for reindeer forage was three times higher in thinned forest. Fertilization negatively affected the lingonberry shrub (Vaccinium vitis-idaea). Timber production increased with fertilization, but decreased with thinning. The potential for C storage was highest in fertilized forests, which, apart from having the highest timber production, also supported the highest standing tree biomass.
   4. The silvicultural practices evaluated induced trade-offs among the ecosystem features studied as thinning increased biodiversity of the ground vegetation, production potential of wild berries and lichens, but reduced timber production and the potential for C storage. Fertilization had the opposite effect, promoting the potential for C storage at the expense of biodiversity and the ecosystem services delivered by the ground vegetation.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Increased multi-use potential is a common goal for forest management in many parts of the world. Our result shows that commonly used silvicultural practices can be used to determine the multi-use output, and might be applied to maintain, or even increase the multi-use potential of the boreal forest biome. Nevertheless, trade-offs among values were common, indicating that the multi-use potential will be limited at the site level. Allowing management objectives to vary across the landscape might, in such cases, be a preferable way to achieve high multi-use potential.

AB This article ties in with a growing international literature examining the link between party politics and welfare service privatization in modern welfare states. In recent decades, a central aspect of policy change in Sweden is that private actors have come to produce publicly financed welfare services on a more regular basis. This overall privatization trend is furthermore characterized by substantial geographical variation across Sweden's 290 municipalities. The ideological attitudes of local politicians have been recognized as particularly important for understanding this development. This article examines the extent to which local politicians' ideological attitudes regarding welfare service privatization are best explained with a partisan approach emphasizing between-party polarization as opposed to a critical perspective that points to the proclaimed significance of ideological consensus between left and right parties in certain municipal contexts. Using multilevel modelling and survey data collected from elected politicians in municipal governments, the empirical findings show substantial differences in attitudes between Conservatives and Social Democrats, irrespective of municipal characteristics - most notably the degree of welfare service privatization. Hence, the results strongly indicate that the partisan approach is much more fruitful compared to the consensus approach as a general explanation for local politicians' attitudes towards welfare service privatization in Sweden. Accordingly, a conclusion is that comparisons at the subnational level within countries are important as a complement to country-comparative studies when attempting to understand the link between political partisanship and welfare service privatization in modern welfare states.

AB Forests are considered crucial assets for sustainable rural development, and contemporary forestry is an industry where production, environmental and social goals can-and should-be handled simultaneously. Swedish family forest owners (FFOs) are expected to both manage and conserve their forests for the benefit of the whole country, but there are contradictions between development and conservation and between traditional and alternative forms of utilization representing dilemmas in rural areas. Tensions between urban and rural areas, between demands on what to produce and protect, are often linked to the FFOs' views on opportunities for forest management. The aim of this study is to identify and analyse the extent to which FFOs perceive that social values have the ability to generate "new" goods and services as a supplement or alternative to traditional forestry, and to suggest how the forests might be managed to render high social values. Fifty-seven interviews were conducted with FFOs (both resident and non-resident). The results indicate that regardless of where they reside, FFOs have a multifunctional view of their forests and forest management, that the social values attached to forests can play an important role in development of local recreation- and forest-based tourism activities, and in this respect they can enhance sustainable rural development. It is, however, not obvious who might start and develop these businesses, since there seems to be a lack of interest among the FFOs themselves.

AB The randomised phase III clinical trial Checkmate-214 showed a survival superiority for the combination of ipilimumab and nivolumab when compared with the previous standard of care in first-line metastatic/advanced clear cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC) (Escudier B, Tannir NM, McDermott DF, et al. CheckMate 214: efficacy and safety of nivolumab plus ipilimumab vs sunitinib for treatment-naive advanced or metastatic renal cell carcinoma, including IMDC risk and PD-L1 expression subgroups. LBA5, ESMO 2017, 2017). These results change the frontline standard of care for this disease and have implications for the selection of subsequent therapies. For this reason the European Association of Urology RCC guidelines have been updated.
   Patient summary: The European Association of Urology guidelines will be updated based on the results of the phase III Checkmate-214 clinical trial. The trial showed superior survival for a combination of ipilimumab and nivolumab (IN), compared with the previous standard of care, in intermediate-and poor-risk patients with metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma. When IN is not safe or feasible, alternative agents such as sunitinib, pazopanib, and cabozantinib should be considered. Furthermore, at present, the data from the trial are immature in favourable-risk patients. Therefore, sunitinib or pazopanib remains the favoured agent for this subgroup of patients.

AB Background: In Alpharadin in Symptomatic Prostate Cancer (ALSYMPCA) trial, radium-223 versus placebo prolonged overall survival with favorable safety in castration-resistant prostate cancer patients with symptomatic bone metastases. Long-term radium-223 monitoring underlies a comprehensive safety and risk/benefit assessment.
   Objective: To report updated ALSYMPCA safety, including long-term safety up to 3 yr after the first injection.
   Design, setting, and participants: Safety analyses from phase 3 randomized ALSYMPCA trial included patients receiving >= 1 study-drug injection (600 radium-223 and 301 placebo). Patients (405 radium-223 and 167 placebo) entered long-term safety follow-up starting 12 wk after the last study-drug injection, to 3 yr from the first injection. Forty-eight of 405 (12%) radium-223 and 12/167 (7%) placebo patients completed follow-up, with evaluations every 2 mo for 6 mo, then every 4 mo until 3 yr.
   Outcome measurements and statistical analysis: All adverse events (AEs) were collected until 12 wk after the last injection; subsequently, only treatment-related AEs were collected. Additional long-term safety was assessed by development of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), aplastic anemia, and secondary malignancies. Data analysis used descriptive statistics.
   Results and limitations: During treatment to 12 wk following the last injection, 564/600 (94%) radium-223 and 292/301 (97%) placebo patients had treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs). Myelosuppression incidence was low. Grade 3/4 hematologic TEAEs in radium-223 and placebo groups were anemia (13% vs 13%), neutropenia (2% vs 1%), and thrombocytopenia (7% vs 2%). Ninety-eight of 600 (16%) radium-223 and 68/301 (23%) placebo patients experienced grade 5 TEAEs. Long-term follow-up showed no AML, MDS, or new primary bone cancer; secondary non-treatment-related malignancies occurred in four radium-223 and three placebo patients. One radium-223 patient had aplastic anemia 16 mo after the last injection. No other cases were observed. Limitations include short (3-yr) follow-up.
   Conclusions: Final long-term safety ALSYMPCA analysis shows that radium-223 remained well tolerated, with low myelosuppression incidence and no new safety concerns. (C) 2017 European Association of Urology. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Climate change-driven increases in winter temperatures positively affect conditions for shrub growth in arctic tundra by decreasing plant frost damage and stimulation of nutrient availability. However, the extent to which shrubs may benefit from these conditions may be strongly dependent on the following spring climate. Species-specific differences in phenology and spring frost sensitivity likely affect shrub growth responses to warming. Additionally, effects of changes in winter and spring climate may differ over small spatial scales, as shrub growth may be dependent on natural variation in snow cover, shrub density and cryoturbation.
   We investigated the effects of winter warming and altered spring climate on growing-season performance of three common and widespread shrub species in cryoturbated non-sorted circle arctic tundra. By insulating sparsely vegetated non-sorted circles and parts of the surrounding heath with additional snow or gardening fleeces, we created two climate change scenarios: snow addition increased soil temperatures in autumn and winter and delayed snowmelt timing without increasing spring temperatures, whereas fleeces increased soil temperature similarly in autumn and winter, but created warmer spring conditions without altering snowmelt timing.
   Winter warming affected shrub performance, but the direction and magnitude were species-specific and dependent on spring conditions. Spring warming advanced, and later snowmelt delayed canopy green-up. The fleece treatment did not affect shoot growth and biomass in any shrub species despite decreasing leaf frost damage in Empetrum nigrum. Snow addition decreased frost damage and stimulated growth of Vaccinium vitis-idaea by c. 50%, while decreasing Betula nana growth (p < .1). All of these effects were consistent the mostly barren circles and surrounding heath.
   Synthesis. In cryoturbated arctic tundra, growth of Vaccinium vitis-idaea may substantially increase when a thicker snow cover delays snowmelt, whereas in longer term, warmer winters and springs may favour E. nigrum instead. This may affect shrub community composition and cover, with potentially far-reaching effects on arctic ecosystem functioning via its effects on cryoturbation, carbon cycling and trophic cascading. Our results highlight the importance of disentangling effects of winter and spring climate change timing and nature, as spring conditions are a crucial factor in determining the impact of winter warming on plant performance.

AB We review the consequences for biodiversity and ecosystem services from the industrial-scale extraction of logging residues (tops, branches and stumps from harvested trees and small-diameter trees from thinnings) in managed forests. Logging residue extraction can replace fossil fuels, and thus contribute to climate change mitigation. The additional biomass and nutrients removed, and soils and other structures disturbed, have several potential environmental impacts. To evaluate potential impacts on ecosystem services and biodiversity we reviewed 279 scientific papers that compared logging residue extraction with non-extraction, the majority of which were conducted in Northern Europe and North America. The weight of available evidence indicates that logging residue extraction can have significant negative effects on biodiversity, especially for species naturally adapted to sun-exposed conditions and the large amounts of dead wood that are created by large-scaled forest disturbances. Slash extraction may also pose risks for future biomass production itself, due to the associated loss of nutrients. For water quality, reindeer herding, mammalian game species, berries, and natural heritage the results were complicated by primarily negative but some positive effects, while for recreation and pest control positive effects were more consistent. Further, there are initial negative effects on carbon storage, but these effects are transient and carbon stocks are mostly restored over decadal time perspectives. We summarize ways of decreasing some of the negative effects of logging residue extraction on specific ecosystem services, by changing the categories of residue extracted, and site or forest type targeted for extraction. However, we found that suggested pathways for minimizing adverse outcomes were often in conflict among the ecosystem services assessed. Compensatory measures for logging residue extraction may also be used (e.g. ash recycling, liming, fertilization), though these may also be associated with adverse environmental impacts.

AB A key weakness in current Earth System Models is the representation of thermal acclimation of photosynthesis in response to changes in growth temperatures. Previous studies in boreal and temperate ecosystems have shown leaf-scale photosynthetic capacity parameters, the maximum rates of carboxylation (V-cmax) and electron transport (J(max)), to be positively correlated with foliar nitrogen (N) content at a given reference temperature. It is also known that V-cmax and J(max) exhibit temperature optima that are affected by various environmental factors and, further, that N partitioning among the foliar photosynthetic pools is affected by N availability. However, despite the strong recent anthropogenic influence on atmospheric temperatures and N deposition to forests, little is known about the role of foliar N contents in controlling the photosynthetic temperature responses. In this study, we investigated the temperature dependencies of V-cmax and J(max) in 1-year-old needles of mature boreal Pinus sylvestris (Scots pine) trees growing under low and high N availabilities in northern Sweden. We found that needle N status did not significantly affect the temperature responses of V-cmax or J(max) when the responses were fitted to a peaked function. If such N insensitivity is a common tree trait it will simplify the interpretation of the results from gradient and multi-species studies, which commonly use sites with differing N availabilities, on temperature acclimation of photosynthetic capacity. Moreover, it will simplify modeling efforts aimed at understanding future carbon uptake by precluding the need to adjust the shape of the temperature response curves to variation in N availability.

ID PERFORMANCE; CAPABILITY; SEMANTICS; DISABILITY; CHILDREN; BATTERY; HOME
AB Based on an argumentation theory approach, we present a novel method for evaluating complex goal-based activities by generalizing a notion of qualifier defined in the health domain. Three instances of the general qualifier are proposed: Performance, Actuation and Capacity; the first one evaluates what a person does, the second how an individual follows an action plan, and the third one how "well" or "bad" an activity is executed. Qualifiers are intended to be used by autonomous systems for evaluating human activity. We exemplify our approach using a health domain assessment protocol. Main results of this test show a partial correlation between ambiguities assessed by experts and our argument-based approach; and a multi-dimensional perspective how an activity is executed when a combined evaluation of qualifiers is used. This last outcome was interesting for some therapists consulted. Results also show differences between values of qualifiers using different argumentation semantics; two scenarios were proposed by therapist for using different semantics: preliminary activity screening and time-span follow-up evaluation.

AB Objective: To explore Tanzanian midwives' experiences and views of the role of obstetric ultrasound in relation to clinical management of pregnancy, and in situations where maternal and fetal health interests conflict.
   Method: In 2015, five focus group discussions were conducted with midwives (N = 31) at three public referral hospitals in the Dar es Salaam region as part of the CROss Country Ultrasound Study (CROCUS).
   Results: Ultrasound was described as decisive for proper management of pregnancy complications. Midwives noted an increasing interest in ultrasound among pregnant women. However, concerns were expressed about the lack of ultrasound equipment and staff capable of skilful operation. Further, counselling regarding medical management was perceived as difficult due to low levels of education among pregnant women.
   Conclusion: Ultrasound has an important role in management of pregnancy complications. However, lack of equipment and shortage of skilled healthcare professionals seem to hamper use of obstetric ultrasound in this particular low-resource setting. Increased availability of obstetric ultrasound seems warranted, but further investments need to be balanced with advanced clinical skills' training as barriers, including power outages and lack of functioning equipment, are likely to continue to limit the provision of pregnancy ultrasound in this setting.

ID EXERCISE; CARE; OVERWEIGHT; DIETARY; ADVICE; SWEDEN
AB Objective: The aims to explore among pregnant women were their experiences of lifestyle counselling provided by a midwife in antenatal care, addressing health promotion with special focus on physical activity during pregnancy, and factors influencing the trustworthiness of counselling conducted by a midwife.
   Methods: This qualitative study collected data from 14 pregnant, primiparous or multiparous women in gestational week 35-36 using in-depth interviews. The data were collected in Sweden in 2015. Qualitative content analysis was applied.
   Results: The theme "Longing for fulfilment of individual needs and expectations" emerged during analysis, including four categories; "Being exposed to unsatisfying counselling"; "Appreciating supportive and trustworthy counselling"; "Wrestling with cultures", and "Dealing with physical activity in daily life". The results indicated that some participants experienced limited counselling that was characterized by lack of knowledge, support, and trustworthiness in the midwife. Other participants reported valuable encouragement and support by the midwife. Participants were longing for individual recognition instead of receiving general advice on physical activity that was designed for all pregnant women.
   Conclusions: Individual counselling on physical activity during pregnancy based on the participant's individual needs was desired. On the contrary, the participants could experience the midwife as having her own agenda, insufficient knowledge and primarily focusing on medical surveillance. There is a need of increased level of knowledge among midwives in antenatal care, regarding lifestyle and lifestyle change during pregnancy. This may enhance promotion of a healthy lifestyle for the pregnant woman during counselling.

AB Objective: To explore obstetricians' experiences and views of the use of obstetric ultrasound in clinical management of pregnancy.
   Methods: A qualitative interview study was undertaken in 2015 with obstetricians (N = 20) in Norway as part of the CROss Country Ultrasound Study (CROCUS).
   Results: Three categories developed during analyses. 'Differing opinions about ultrasound and prenatal diagnosis policies' revealed divergent views in relation to Norwegian policies for ultrasound screening and prenatal diagnosis. Down syndrome screening was portrayed as a delicate and frequently debated issue, with increasing ethical challenges due to developments in prenatal diagnosis. 'Ultrasound's influence on the view of the fetus' illuminated how ultrasound influenced obstetricians' views of the fetus as a 'patient' and a 'person'. They also saw ultrasound as strongly influencing expectant parents' views of the fetus, and described how ultrasound was sometimes used as a means of comforting women when complications occurred. The complexity of information and counselling' revealed how obstetricians balanced the medical and social aspects of the ultrasound examination, and the difficulties of 'delivering bad news' and counselling in situations of uncertain findings.
   Conclusion: This study highlights obstetricians' experiences and views of ultrasound and prenatal diagnosis in Norwegian maternity care and the challenges associated with the provision of these services, including counselling dilemmas and perceived differences in expectations between caregivers and expectant parents. There was notable diversity among these obstetricians in relation to their support of, and adherence to Norwegian regulations about the use of ultrasound, which indicates that the care pregnant women receive may vary accordingly.

AB Aims/hypothesis There is considerable variability in how diabetes progresses after diagnosis. Progression modelling has largely focused on 'time to failure' methods, yet determining a 'coefficient of failure' has many advantages. We derived a rate of glycaemic deterioration in type 2 diabetes, using a large real-world cohort, and aimed to investigate the clinical, biochemical, pharmacological and immunological variables associated with fast and slow rates of glycaemic deterioration.
   Methods An observational cohort study was performed using the electronic medical records from participants in the Genetics of Diabetes Audit and Research in Tayside Study (GoDARTS). A model was derived based on an individual's observed HbA(1c) measures from the first eligible HbA(1c) after the diagnosis of diabetes through to the study end (defined as insulin initiation, death, leaving the area or end of follow-up). Each HbA(1c) measure was time-dependently adjusted for the effects of non-insulin glucose-lowering drugs, changes in BMI and corticosteroid use. GAD antibody (GADA) positivity was defined as GAD titres above the 97.5th centile of the population distribution.
   Results The mean (95% CI) glycaemic deterioration for type 2 diabetes and GADA-positive individuals was 1.4 (1.3, 1.4) and 2.8 (2.4, 3.3) mmol/mol HbA(1c) per year, respectively. A younger age of diagnosis, lower HDL-cholesterol concentration, higher BMI and earlier calendar year of diabetes diagnosis were independently associated with higher rates of glycaemic deterioration in individuals with type 2 diabetes. The rate of deterioration in those diagnosed at over 70 years of age was very low, with 66% having a rate of deterioration of less than 1.1 mmol/mol HbA(1c) per year, and only 1.5% progressing more rapidly than 4.4 mmol/mol HbA(1c) per year.
   Conclusions/interpretation We have developed a novel approach for modelling the progression of diabetes in observational data across multiple drug combinations. This approach highlights how glycaemic deterioration in those diagnosed at over 70 years of age is minimal, supporting a stratified approach to diabetes management.

AB Intensive care participants that need dialysis frequently suffer from increased risk of bleeding. Standard intermittent haemodialysis (SHD) includes anticoagulation to avoid clotting of the dialysis system. The aim of this study was to clarify which of four different low-dose anticoagulant modes was preferable in reducing the exposure to i.v. unfractionated heparin (heparin) and maintaining patency of the dialysis circuit.
   Twenty-three patients on SHD were included to perform haemodialysis with four modes of low-dose anticoagulation. For comparative analyses, patients served as their own control. Haemodialysis with a single bolus of tinzaparin at the start was compared to haemodialysis initiated without i.v. heparin but priming with (1) heparin in saline (H), (2) heparin and albumin in saline (HA), (3) heparin and albumin in combination with a citrate-containing dialysate (HAC), (4) saline and usinga heparin-coated filters (EvodialA (R)). The priming fluid was discarded before dialysis started. Blood samples were collected at 0, 30 and 180 min during haemodialysis. Smaller bolus doses of heparin (500 Units/dose) were allowed during the modes to avoid interruption by clotting.
   The mean activated partial thromboplastin (APTT) time as well as the doses of anticoagulation administered was highest with SHD and least with HAC and EvodialA (R). Mode H versus SHD had the highest rate of prematurely interrupted dialyses (33%, p = 0.008). The urea reduction rate was less with EvodialA (R) vs. SHD (p < 0.01). One hypersensitivity reaction occurred with EvodialA (R). Changes in blood cell concentrations and triglycerides differed between the modes.
   If intermittent haemodialysis is necessary in patients at risk of bleeding, anticoagulation using HAC and EvodialA (R) appeared most preferable with least administration of heparin, lowest APTT increase and lowest risk for prematurely clotted dialyzers in contrast to the least plausible H mode.

AB Improved forage management can support increased production in smallholder beef systems. Our objective was to evaluate the effects of mineral nitrogen (urea) and composted cattle manure on Brachiaria cv. Mulato II yield and nutritive value in south-central coastal Vietnam. Study design was a randomized complete block on six farms (blocks), with treatments derived from the factorial combination of five rates of composted cattle manure (0, 4, 8, 12 and 24 MgDMha(-1)year(-1)) and three urea rates (0, 60 and 120kgNha(-1)year(-1)), split into six yearly applications. Yield was measured from 2011 to 2013 with 36-day average harvest intervals. Forage nutritive value was measured in September 2011 and December 2012. Highest yields were achieved when both compost and urea were applied at high rates. The initial yield and tiller responses to urea application were not sustained over the duration of the study when no compost was applied. Compost applied in isolation did not increase yield. Compost application increased ash concentration. Urea increased nutrient yield for all forage nutritive value parameters measured. Composted cattle manure combined with urea benefits grass yield, but high application rates are needed for sustained high yields on sandy soils.

AB Mutations in COQ8B cause steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome with variable neurological involvement. In yeast, COQ8 encodes a protein required for coenzyme Q (CoQ) biosynthesis, whose precise role is not clear. Humans harbor two paralog genes: COQ8A and COQ8B (previously termed ADCK3 and ADCK4). We have found that COQ8B is a mitochondrial matrix protein peripherally associated with the inner membrane. COQ8B can complement a Delta COQ8 yeast strain when its mitochondrial targeting sequence (MTS) is replaced by a yeast MTS. This model was employed to validate COQ8B mutations, and to establish genotype-phenotype correlations. All mutations affected respiratory growth, but there was no correlation between mutation type and the severity of the phenotype. In fact, contrary to the case of COQ2, where residual CoQ biosynthesis correlates with clinical severity, patients harboring hypomorphic COQ8B alleles did not display a different phenotype compared with those with null mutations. These data also suggest that the system is redundant, and that other proteins (probably COQ8A) may partially compensate for the absence of COQ8B. Finally, a COQ8B polymorphism, present in 50% of the European population (NM_024876.3:c.521A > G, p.His174Arg), affects stability of the protein and could represent a risk factor for secondary CoQ deficiencies or for other complex traits.

AB The objective of this study was to develop and evaluate brief Motivational Interviewing (MI) to facilitate behaviour change in women at high risk of contracting sexually transmitted infections (STIs). One hundred and seventy-three women (mean age 24.7) at high risk of contracting STIs were randomized to a brief risk-reducing MI counselling intervention (n=74) or assigned to the control group (n=99). MI skill was assessed using the Motivational Interviewing Treatment Integrity (MITI) Coding System. Seventeen of 74 (23%) women tested for Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) in the MI intervention group and 22 of 99 (22%) in the control group had a genital CT infection 0-24 months before baseline. All additional CT testing was monitored up to 24 months for all 173 women in the study. None of the 49 CT-retested women in the MI group was CT infected, as compared to 3 of 72 (4%) women in the control group. A generalized estimating equations model with sexual high-risk behaviour measured at baseline and at six-month follow-up produced an adjusted estimated odds ratio of 0.38 (95% confidence interval=0.158, 0.909), indicating efficacy. Brief manual-based single-session MI counselling seems to be effective in reducing high-risk sexual behaviour in women at high risk of acquiring STIs.

AB The current study investigates the relevance of positive attitudes toward Internet technologies for psychological well-being and social well-being in old age. A sample of 245 elderly people (Mean age = 70; SD =9.1) filled in the Psychological Well-Being Questionnaire, the Social Well-Being Questionnaire, and Attitudes Toward Technologies Questionnaire (ATTQ). Favorable attitudes toward Internet technologies showed positive correlations with overall social well-being and all its components with the exception of social acceptance. Positive correlations with overall psychological well-being and two of its components, namely, personal growth and purpose in life, were also found. Two hierarchical multiple regression models underscored that positive attitudes toward Internet technologies constitute the most important predictor of social well-being, and it appears to be a significant predictor for psychological well-being as well. Results are discussed and integrated into the Positive Technology theoretical framework that sustains the value of technological resources for improving the quality of personal experience and well-being.

   EXPRESSION
AB Metacaspases (MCs) are cysteine proteases that are implicated in programmed cell death of plants. AtMC9 (Arabidopsis thaliana Metacaspase9) is a member of the Arabidopsis MC family that controls the rapid autolysis of the xylem vessel elements, but its downstream targets in xylem remain uncharacterized.
   PttMC13 and PttMC14 were identified as AtMC9 homologs in hybrid aspen (Populustremulaxtremuloides). A proteomic analysis was conducted in xylem tissues of transgenic hybrid aspen trees which carried either an overexpression or an RNA interference construct for PttMC13 and PttMC14.
   The proteomic analysis revealed modulation of levels of both previously known targets of metacaspases, such as Tudor staphylococcal nuclease, heat shock proteins and 14-3-3 proteins, as well as novel proteins, such as homologs of the PUTATIVE ASPARTIC PROTEASE3 (PASPA3) and the cysteine protease RD21 by PttMC13 and PttMC14.
   We identified here the pathways and processes that are modulated by PttMC13 and PttMC14 in xylem tissues. In particular, the results indicate involvement of PttMC13 and/or PttMC14 in downstream proteolytic processes and cell death of xylem elements. This work provides a valuable reference dataset on xylem-specific metacaspase functions for future functional and biochemical analyses.

AB BackgroundGrowing up with congenital heart disease (CHD) often means transfer to adult care and lifelong medical follow-up. An optimal transition process usually involves a multipart collaboration between the patient, their parents and other family members, and the healthcare providers. Taking an active role while knowing when it is time to step aside can be difficult for all the concerned parties, even the healthcare professionals. The aim of the present study therefore, was to explore parents' expectations and needs during their adolescent's transition to adult care.
   MethodSemi-structured interviews were conducted with 18 parents of 16 adolescents (aged 13-18years) with CHD in 4 pediatric cardiology settings in Sweden. The interviews were analysed with qualitative content analysis.
   ResultsThe analysis resulted in 2 main themes: (a) Feeling securethe importance of being prepared and informed. This theme focused on the need to be prepared and informed about transition and future transfer to adult care. (b) Recognizing when to hand over at the right time. This theme addressed the process of handing over the responsibility from the parent to the adolescents and contained handing over from pediatric care to adult care.
   ConclusionBeing prepared and informed about the upcoming transition process was essential. The parents underlined the importance of being involved in the transition planning for gradually handing over responsibility to the adolescent. They also considered establishing contact with the adult healthcare team before transfer as important and needed to be assured that CHD-related information of importance for the young person's daily life would be given.

AB Tikhonov regularization is one of the most commonly used methods for the regularization of ill-posed problems. In the setting of finite element solutions of elliptic partial differential control problems, Tikhonov regularization amounts to adding suitably weighted least squares terms of the control variable, or derivatives thereof, to the Lagrangian determining the optimality system. In this note we show that the stabilization methods for discretely illposed problems developed in the setting of convection-dominated convection-diffusion problems, can be highly suitable for stabilizing optimal control problems, and that Tikhonov regularization will lead to less accurate discrete solutions. We consider some inverse problems for Poisson's equation as an illustration and derive new error estimates both for the reconstruction of the solution from the measured data and reconstruction of the source term from the measured data. These estimates include both the effect of the discretization error and error in the measurements.

AB Small CAB-like proteins (SCPs) are single-helix light-harvesting-like proteins found in all organisms performing oxygenic photosynthesis. We investigated the effect of growth in moderate salt stress on these stress-induced proteins in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 depleted of Photosystem I (PSI), which expresses SCPs constitutively, and compared these cells with a PSI-less/ScpABCDE(-) mutant. SCPs, by stabilizing chlorophyll-binding proteins and Photosystem II (PSII) assembly, protect PSII from photoinhibitory damages, and in their absence electrons accumulate and will lead to ROS formation. The presence of 0.2 M NaCl in the growth medium increased the respiratory activity and other PSII electron sinks in the PSI-less/ScpABCDE(-) strain. We postulate that this salt-induced effect consumes the excess of PSII-generated electrons, reduces the pressure of the electron transport chain, and thereby prevents O-1(2) production.

AB Plants and algae have developed various light-harvesting mechanisms for optimal delivery of excitation energy to the photosystems. Cryptophyte algae have evolved a novel soluble light-harvesting antenna utilizing phycobilin pigments to complement the membrane-intrinsic Chl a/c-binding LHC antenna. This new antenna consists of the plastid-encoded beta-subunit, a relic of the ancestral phycobilisome, and a novel nuclear-encoded alpha-subunit unique to cryptophytes. Together, these proteins form the active alpha(1)beta center dot alpha(2)beta-tetramer. In all cryptophyte algae investigated so far, the alpha-subunits have duplicated and diversified into a large gene family. Although there is transcriptional evidence for expression of all these genes, the X-ray structures determined to date suggest that only two of the alpha-subunit genes might be significantly expressed at the protein level. Using proteomics, we show that in phycoerythrin 545 (PE545) of Guillardia theta, the only cryptophyte with a sequenced genome, all 20 alpha-subunits are expressed when the algae grow under white light. The expression level of each protein depends on the intensity of the growth light, but there is no evidence for a specific light-dependent regulation of individual members of the alpha-subunit family under the growth conditions applied. GtcpeA10 seems to be a special member of the alpha-subunit family, because it consists of two similar N- and C-terminal domains, which likely are the result of a partial tandem gene duplication. The proteomics data of this study have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium and have the dataset identifiers PXD006301 and 10.6019/PXD006301.

AB BackgroundMicroseminoprotein-beta (MSMB) is a major secretory product from prostate epithelial cells. MSMB synthesis is decreased in prostate tumors in relation to tumor grade. MSMB levels are also reduced in the circulation and MSMB is therefore used as a serum biomarker for prostate cancer. We hypothesized that cancers induce a reduction in MSMB synthesis also in the benign parts of the prostate, and that the magnitude of this response is related to tumor aggressiveness. Reduced levels of MSMB in the circulation could therefore be a consequence of reduced MSMB expression not only in tumor tissue but also in the benign prostate tissue.
   MethodsMSMB expression was analyzed in prostatectomy specimens from 36 patients using immunohistochemistry and qRT-PCR. MSMB expression in the benign prostate tissue was analyzed in relation to Gleason score, tumor stage, and distance to the tumor. Furthermore, Dunning rat prostate tumors with different aggressiveness were implanted into the prostate of Copenhagen rats to study if this affected the MSMB expression in the tumor-adjacent benign rat prostate tissue.
   ResultsIn prostatectomy specimens, MSMB expression was reduced in prostate tumors but also in the tumor-adjacent benign parts of the prostate. The reduction in tumor MSMB was related to tumor grade and stage, and the reduction in the benign parts of the prostate to tumor grade, stage, and distance to the tumor. Implantation of Dunning cancer cells into the rat prostate resulted in reduced MSMB protein levels in the tumor-adjacent benign prostate tissue. Rapidly growing and metastatic MatLyLu tumors had a more pronounced effect than slow-growing non-metastatic G tumors.
   ConclusionOur data suggest that aggressive prostate tumors suppress MSMB synthesis in the benign prostate and that this could explain why serum levels of MSMB are decreased in prostate cancer patients. This study suggests that markers for aggressive cancer can be found among factors altered in parallel in prostate tumors and in the adjacent benign tissue.

AB We study a varying coefficient partially nonlinear model in which the regressors are generated by the multivariate unit root processes. A profile nonlinear least squares estimation procedure is applied to estimate the parameter vector and the functional coefficients. Under some mild conditions, the asymptotic distribution theory for the resulting estimators is established. The rate of convergence for the parameter vector estimator depends on the properties of the nonlinear regression function, However, the rate of convergence for the functional coefficients estimator is the same and enjoys the super-consistency property. Furthermore, a simulation study is conducted to investigate the finite sample performance of the proposed estimating procedures. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this contribution we develop a cut finite element method with boundary value correction of the type originally proposed by Bramble, Dupont, and Thomee in [Math. Comp. 26 (1972), 869-879]. The cut finite element method is a fictitious domain method with Nitsche-type enforcement of Dirich-let conditions together with stabilization of the elements at the boundary which is stable and enjoy optimal order approximation properties. A computational difficulty is, however, the geometric computations related to quadrature on the cut elements which must be accurate enough to achieve higher order approximation. With boundary value correction we may use only a piecewise linear approximation of the boundary, which is very convenient in a cut finite element method, and still obtain optimal order convergence. The boundary value correction is a modified Nitsche formulation involving a Taylor expansion in the normal direction compensating for the approximation of the boundary. Key to the analysis is a consistent stabilization term which enables us to prove stability of the method and a priori error estimates with explicit dependence on the meshsize and distance between the exact and approximate boundary.

AB Hydrothermal carbons have been shown to have controllable surface functionalization through various post-treatment techniques, which indicates these materials may be tuned for specific applications. For this reason, Near Edge X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (NEXAFS) studies have been conducted on a series of nitrogen doped and non-doped heat treated and activated hydrothermal carbons to further understand the changes in surface functionality with treatment. The NEXAFS carbon K-edge spectrum of the non-doped samples displayed a loss of oxygen functionalities (C=O and C-OH) as well as the furan ring structure with increasing temperature, while C=C bonds from graphitic groups increased. This effect was amplified further upon the addition of phosphoric acid (H3PO4) during activation. The doped hydrothermal carbons displayed similar functionality to the non-doped, although the effect of both heat treatment and activation was diminished. The nitrogen K-edge displayed characteristic peaks for pyridine and imines/amides, with pyrroles located under the broad ionization step. This work represents the first time a series of heat treated and activated hydrothermal carbons have been examined via NEXAFS spectroscopy. Additionally, difference analysis has been applied to the NEXAFS spectra to obtain a deeper understanding in the changes in surface functionality, a previously unused technique for these materials.

AB We present an efficient procedure for computing resonances and resonant modes of Helmholtz problems posed in exterior domains. The problem is formulated as a nonlinear eigenvalue problem (NEP), where the nonlinearity arises from the use of a Dirichlet-toNeumann map, which accounts for modeling unbounded domains. We consider a variational formulation and show that the spectrum consists of isolated eigenvalues of finite multiplicity that only can accumulate at infinity. The proposed method is based on a high order finite element discretization combined with a specialization of the Tensor Infinite Arnoldi method (TIAR). Using Toeplitz matrices, we show how to specialize this method to our specific structure. In particular we introduce a pole cancellation technique in order to increase the radius of convergence for computation of eigenvalues that lie close to the poles of the matrix-valued function. The solution scheme can be applied to multiple resonators with a varying refractive index that is not necessarily piecewise constant. We present two test cases to show stability, performance and numerical accuracy of the method. In particular the use of a high order finite element discretization together with TIAR results in an efficient and reliable method to compute resonances. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Four acceptor-donor-acceptor (A-D-A) type small molecules using naphtho-dithiophene as central building block, trithiophene as -bridges, malononitrile and 2-Thioxo-thiazolidin-4-one as end acceptor groups were designed by using density functional theory (DFT) and investigated as donor materials for organic solar cells (OSCs). The effects of end acceptor groups on absorption, charge transport, morphology, energy level and photovoltaic properties of the molecules were investigated and compared with reference molecule (R1= NDTP-CNCOO). These designed molecules showed relatively low HOMO levels of -5.46 to -5.56eV, strong absorption between 440-650nm by using chloroform as solvent. The designed donor molecules have an excellent electron mobility from 0.0161 to 0.0201V, hole mobility from 0.0275 to 0.0307V and open circuit voltage (Voc) from 1.76 to 1.86V. This study revealed that the designed donor materials are suitable and recommended for high performance organic solar cell devices.

AB Background: The purpose of this study is to validate a new five-tiered prognostic classification system to better discriminate cancer-specific mortality in men diagnosed with primary non-metastatic prostate cancer.& para;& para;Methods: We applied a recently described five-strata model, the Cambridge Prognostic Groups (CPGs 1-5), in two international cohorts and tested prognostic performance against the current standard three-strata classification of low-, intermediate- or high-risk disease. Diagnostic clinico-pathological data for men obtained from the Prostate Cancer data Base Sweden (PCBaSe) and the Singapore Health Study were used. The main outcome measure was prostate cancer mortality (PCM) stratified by age group and treatment modality.& para;& para;Results: The PCBaSe cohort included 72,337 men, of whom 7162 died of prostate cancer. The CPG model successfully classified men with different risks of PCM with competing risk regression confirming significant intergroup distinction (p < 0.0001). The CPGs were significantly better at stratified prediction of PCM compared to the current three-tiered system (concordance index (C-index) 0.81 vs. 0.77, p < 0.0001). This superiority was maintained for every age group division (p < 0.0001). Also in the ethnically different Singapore cohort of 2550 men with 142 prostate cancer deaths, the CPG model outperformed the three strata categories (C-index 0.79 vs. 0.76, p < 0.0001). The model also retained superior prognostic discrimination in the treatment sub-groups: radical prostatectomy (n = 20,586), C-index 0.77 vs. 074; radiotherapy (n = 11,872), C-index 0.73 vs. 0.69; and conservative management (n = 14,950), C-index 0.74 vs. 0.73. The CPG groups that sub-divided the old intermediate-risk (CPG2 vs. CPG3) and high-risk categories (CPG4 vs. CPG5) significantly discriminated PCM outcomes after radical therapy or conservative management (p < 0.0001).& para;& para;Conclusions: This validation study of nearly 75,000 men confirms that the CPG five-tiered prognostic model has superior discrimination compared to the three-tiered model in predicting prostate cancer death across different age and treatment groups. Crucially, it identifies distinct sub-groups of men within the old intermediate-risk and high-risk criteria who have very different prognostic outcomes. We therefore propose adoption of the CPG model as a simple-to-use but more accurate prognostic stratification tool to help guide management for men with newly diagnosed prostate cancer.

AB Epidemiology and outcome of myeloma are mainly reported from large university centers and collaborative groups, and do not represent 'real-world' patients. The Swedish Myeloma Registry is a prospective population-based registry documenting characteristics, treatment and outcome in newly diagnosed myeloma, including asymptomatic and localized forms, with the purpose of improving disease management and outcome. This report presents information on patients diagnosed between 2008 and 2015, including data on first-line treatment in patients diagnosed up to 2014, with a follow up until December 2016. We present age-adjusted incidence, patients' characteristics at baseline, treatment, response, and survival. Baseline data were available with a 97% coverage in 4904 patients (median age 71 years, males 70 years, females 73 years; 72% were 65 years or older), and at 1-year follow up in 3558 patients with symptomatic disease (92% of patients initially reported). The age-adjusted incidence was 6.8 myeloma cases per 100,000 inhabi-ants per year. Among initially symptomatic patients (n= 3988), 77% had osteolytic lesions or compression fractures, 49% had anemia, 18% impaired kidney function, and 13% hypercalcemia. High-dose therapy with autologous stem cell transplantation was given to 77% of patients aged up to 66 years, and to 22% of patients aged 66-70 years. In the study period, 68% received bortezomib, thalidomide, and/or lenalidomide as part of the first-line treatment, rising from 31% in 2008 to 81% in 2014. In active myeloma, the median relative survival of patients aged 65 years or under was 7.7 years, and 3.4 years in patients aged 66 years and over. Patients diagnosed with myeloma in more recent years were associated with significantly higher rates of complete or very good partial remission (P<0.05), and with a significantly higher survival, with a Hazard Ratio (HR) of 0.84 (95% CI: 0.77-0.92; P<0.05). There was a small, but significant survival benefit in patients treated at university hospitals (HR 0.93; 95% CI: 0.87-0.99; P<0.05). We report here on a near complete 'real-world' population of myeloma patients during an 8-year period; a period in which newer drugs were implemented into standard practice. The overall incidence and median age were both higher than in most previous studies, indicating a more complete coverage of older patients. Myeloma survival in Sweden is comparable to other large registry studies, and responses and survival improved during the study period.

AB Melphalan at a dose of 200 mg/m(2) is standard conditioning prior to autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for multiple myeloma, but a dose of 140 mg/m(2) is often used in clinical practice in patients perceived to be at risk of excess toxicity. To determine whether melphalan 200 mg/m(2) and melphalan 140 mg/m(2) are equally effective and tolerable in clinically relevant patient subgroups we analyzed 1964 first single autologous transplantation episodes using a series of Cox proportional-hazards models. Overall survival, progression-free survival, cumulative incidence of relapse, non-relapse mortality, hematopoietic recovery and second primary malignancy rates were not significantly different between the melphalan 140 mg/m(2) (n=245) and melphalan 200 mg/m(2) (n=1719) groups. Multivariable subgroup analysis showed that disease status at transplantation interacted with overall survival, progression-free survival, and cumulative incidence of relapse, with a significant advantage associated with melphalan 200 mg/m(2) in patients transplanted in less than partial response (adjusted hazard ratios for melphalan 200 mg/m(2) versus melphalan 140 mg/m(2): 0.5, 0.54, and 0.56). In contrast, transplantation in very good partial or complete response significantly favored melphalan 140 mg/m(2) for overall survival (adjusted hazard ratio: 2.02). Age, renal function, prior proteasome inhibitor treatment, gender, or Karnofsky score did not interact with overall/progression-free survival or relapse rate in the melphalan dose groups. There were no significant survival or relapse rate differences between melphalan 200 mg/m(2) and melphalan 140 mg/m(2) patients with high-risk or standard-risk chromosomal abnormalities. In conclusion, remission status at the time of transplantation may favor the use of melphalan 200 mg/m(2) or melphalan 140 mg/m(2) for key transplant outcomes (NCT01362972).

AB During amino acid starvation the Escherichia coli stringent response factor RelA recognizes deacylated tRNA in the ribosomal A-site. This interaction activates RelA-mediated synthesis of alarmone nucleotides pppGpp and ppGpp, collectively referred to as (p)ppGpp. These two alarmones are synthesized by addition of a pyrophosphate moiety to the 3' position of the abundant cellular nucleotide GTP and less abundant nucleotide GDP, respectively. Using untagged native RelA we show that allosteric activation of RelA by pppGpp increases the efficiency of GDP conversion to achieve the maximum rate of (p) ppGpp production. Using a panel of ribosomal RNA mutants, we show that the A-site finger structural element of 23S rRNA helix 38 is crucial for RelA binding to the ribosome and consequent activation, and deletion of the element severely compromises (p) ppGpp accumulation in E. coli upon amino acid starvation. Through binding assays and enzymology, we show that E. coli RelA does not form a stable complex with, and is not activated by, deacylated tRNA off the ribosome. This indicates that in the cell, RelA first binds the empty A-site and then recruits tRNA rather than first binding tRNA and then binding the ribosome.

AB In this study, a novel macroporous composite biomaterial consisting of gelatin-hydroxyapatite-calcium sulphate for delivery of bone morphogenic protein-2 (rhBMP-2) and zoledronic acid (ZA) has been developed. The biomaterial scaffold has a porous structure and functionalization of the scaffold with rhBMP-2 induces osteogenic differentiation of MC3T3-e1 cells seen by a significant increase in biochemical and genetic markers of osteoblastic differentiation. In-vivo muscle pouch experiments showed higher mineralization using scaffold + rhBMP-2 when compared to an approved absorbable collagen sponge (ACS) + rhBMP-2 as verified by micro-CT. Co-delivery of rhBMP-2 + ZA via the novel scaffold enabled a reduction in the effective rhBMP-2 doses. The presence of tartrate resistant acid phosphatase staining in the rhBMP-2 group indicates osteoclastic resorption, which could be stalled by adding ZA, which by speculation could explain the net increase in mineralization. The new scaffold allowed for slow release of rhBMP-2 in-vitro (3.3 +/- 0.1%) after 4 weeks. Using single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), the release kinetics of I-125-rhBMP-2 in-vivo was followed for 4 weeks and a total of 65.3 +/- 15.2% I-125-rhBMP-2 was released from the scaffolds. In-vitro C-14-ZA release curve shows an initial burst release on day 1 (8.8 +/- 0.7%) followed by a slow release during the following 4 weeks (13 +/- 0.1%). In-vivo, an initial release of 43.2 +/- 7.6% of C-14-ZA was detected after 1 day, after which the scaffold retained the remaining ZA during 4-weeks. Taken together, our results show that the developed biomaterial is an efficient carrier for spatio-temporal delivery of rhBMP-2 and ZA leading to increased bone formation compared to commercially available carrier for rhBMP-2.

AB Silica-bearing waters in nature often alter the reactivity of mineral surfaces via deposition of Si complexes and solids. In this work, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy was used to identify hydroxo groups at goethite (alpha-FeOOH) and lepidocrocite (gamma-FeOOH) surfaces that are targeted by ligand exchange reactions with monomeric silicate species. Measurements of samples first reacted in aqueous solutions then dried under N-2(g) enabled resolution of the signature O-H stretching bands of singly (-OH), doubly (mu-OH), and triply coordinated (mu(3)-OH) groups. Samples reacted with Si for 3 and 30 d at pH 4 and 7 revealed that -OH groups were preferentially exchanged by silicate and that mu-OH and mu(3)-OH groups were not exchanged. Based on knowledge of the disposition of -OH groups on the major crystallographic faces of goethite and lepidocrocite, and the response of these groups to ligand exchange prior oligomerization, our work points to the predominance of rows of mononuclear monodentate silicate species, each separated by at least one -OH group. These species are the attachment sites from which oligomerization and polymerization reactions occur, starting at loadings exceeding similar to 1 Si/nm(2) and corresponding to soluble Si concentrations that can be as low as similar to 0.7 mM after 30 d reaction time. Only above such loadings can reaction products grow away from rows of -OH groups and form hydrogen bonds with nonexchangeable mu-OH and mu(3)-OH groups. These findings have important repercussions for our understanding of the fate of waterborne silicate ions exposed to minerals.

AB Staphylococcus aureus produces membrane-derived vesicles (MVs), which share functional properties to outer membrane vesicles. Atomic force microscopy revealed that S. aureus-derived MVs are associated with the bacterial surface or released into the surrounding environment depending on bacterial growth conditions. By using a comparative proteomic approach, a total of 131 and 617 proteins were identified in MVs isolated from S. aureus grown in Luria-Bertani and brain-heart infusion broth, respectively. Purified S. aureus MVs derived from the bacteria grown in either media induced comparable levels of cytotoxicity and neutrophil-activation. Administration of exogenous MVs increased the resistance of S. aureus to killing by whole blood or purified human neutrophils ex vivo and increased S. aureus survival in vivo. Finally, immunization of mice with S. aureus-derived MVs induced production of IgM, total IgG, IgG1, IgG2a, and IgG2b resulting in protection against subcutaneous and systemic S. aureus infection. Collectively, our results suggest S. aureus MVs can influence bacterial-host interactions during systemic infections and provide protective immunity in murine models of infection.

TI 3D printed water-soluble scaffolds for rapid production of PDMS
   micro-fluidic flow chambers
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS

DT Article
ID MICROFLUIDIC DEVICES
AB We report a novel method for fabrication of three-dimensional (3D) biocompatible micro-fluidic flow chambers in polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) by 3D-printing water-soluble polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) filaments as master scaffolds. The scaffolds are first embedded in the PDMS and later residue-free dissolved in water leaving an inscription of the scaffolds in the hardened PDMS. We demonstrate the strength of our method using a regular, cheap 3D printer, and evaluate the inscription process and the channels micro-fluidic properties using image analysis and digital holographic microscopy. Furthermore, we provide a protocol that allows for direct printing on coverslips and we show that flow chambers with a channel cross section down to 40 mu m x 300 mu m can be realized within 60 min. These flow channels are perfectly transparent, biocompatible and can be used for microscopic applications without further treatment. Our proposed protocols facilitate an easy, fast and adaptable production of micro-fluidic channel designs that are cost-effective, do not require specialized training and can be used for a variety of cell and bacterial assays. To help readers reproduce our micro-fluidic devices, we provide: full preparation protocols, 3D-printing CAD files for channel scaffolds and our custom-made molding device, 3D printer build-plate leveling instructions, and G-code.

AB Detailed phenotyping is required to deepen our understanding of the biological mechanisms behind genetic associations. In addition, the impact of potentially modifiable risk factors on disease requires analytical frameworks that allow causal inference. Here, we discuss the characteristics of Recall-by-Genotype (RbG) as a study design aimed at addressing both these needs. We describe two broad scenarios for the application of RbG: studies using single variants and those using multiple variants. We consider the efficacy and practicality of the RbG approach, provide a catalogue of UK-based resources for such studies and present an online RbG study planner.

AB Genome editing with the CRISPR-Cas9 system has enabled unprecedented efficacy for reverse genetics and gene correction approaches. While off-target effects have been successfully tackled, the effort to eliminate variability in sgRNA efficacies-which affect experimental sensitivity-is in its infancy. To address this issue, studies have analyzed the molecular features of highly active sgRNAs, but independent cross-validation is lacking. Utilizing fluorescent reporter knock-out assays with verification at selected endogenous loci, we experimentally quantified the target efficacies of 430 sgRNAs. Based on this dataset we tested the predictive value of five recently-established prediction algorithms. Our analysis revealed a moderate correlation (r = 0.04 to r = 0.20) between the predicted and measured activity of the sgRNAs, and modest concordance between the different algorithms. We uncovered a strong PAM-distal GC-content-dependent activity, which enabled the exclusion of inactive sgRNAs. By deriving nine additional predictive features we generated a linear model-based discrete system for the efficient selection (r = 0.4) of effective sgRNAs (CRISPRater). We proved our algorithms' efficacy on small and large external datasets, and provide a versatile combined on-and off-target sgRNA scanning platform. Altogether, our study highlights current issues and efforts in sgRNA efficacy prediction, and provides an easily-applicable discrete system for selecting efficient sgRNAs.

AB This study presents the energy, water, and carbon (C) flux dynamics of a young afforested temperate white pine (Pines strobus L.) forest in southern Ontario, Canada during the initial fourteen years (2003-2016) of establishment. Energy fluxes, namely, net radiation (Rn), latent heat (LE), and sensible heat (H) flux increased over time, due to canopy development. Annual values of ground heat flux (G) peaked in 2007 and then gradually declined in response to canopy closure. The forest became a consistent C-sink only 5 years after establishment owing in part to low respiratory fluxes from the former agricultural, sandy soils with low residual soil organic matter. Mean annual values of gross ecosystem productivity (GEP), ecosystem respiration (RE), and net ecosystem productivity (NEP) ranged from 494 to 1913, 515 to 1774 and -126 to 216 g Cm-2 year(-1) respectively, over the study period. Annual evapotranspiration (ET) values ranged from 328 to 429 mm year(-1) over the same period. Water use efficiency (WUE) increased with stand age with a mean WUE value of 3.92 g C kg-(1) H2O from 2008 to 2016. Multivariable linear regression analysis conducted using observed data suggested that the overall, C and water dynamics of the stand were primarily driven by radiation and temperature, both of which explained 77%, 48%, 28%, and 76% of the variability in GEP, RE, NEP, and ET, respectively. However, late summer droughts, which were prevalent in the region, reduced NEP. The reduction in NEP was enhanced when summer drought events were accompanied by increased heat such as those in 2005, 2012 and 2016. This study contributes to our understanding of the energy, water and C dynamics of afforested temperate conifer plantations and how these forests may respond to changing climate conditions during the crucial initial stage of their life cycle. Our findings also demonstrate the potential of pine plantation stands to sequester atmospheric CO2 in eastern North America.

TI Cost-effectiveness of prenatal food and micronutrient interventions on

AB Introduction
   Nutrition interventions may have favourable as well as unfavourable effects. The Maternal and Infant Nutrition Interventions in Matlab (MINIMat), with early prenatal food and micronutrient supplementation, reduced infant mortality and were reported to be very cost-effective. However, the multiple micronutrients (MMS) supplement was associated with an increased risk of stunted growth in infancy and early childhood. This unfavourable outcome was not included in the previous cost-effectiveness analysis. The aim of this study is to evaluate whether the MINIMat interventions remain cost-effective in view of both favourable (decreased under-five-years mortality) and unfavourable (increased stunting) outcomes.
   Method
   Pregnant women in rural Bangladesh, where food insecurity still is prevalent, were randomized to early (E) or usual (U) invitation to be given food supplementation and daily doses of 30 mg, or 60 mg iron with 400 mu g of folic acid, or MMS with 15 micronutrients including 30 mg iron and 400 mu g of folic acid. E reduced stunting at 4.5 years compared with U, MMS increased stunting at 4.5 years compared with Fe60, while the combination EMMS reduced infant mortality compared with UFe60. The outcome measure used was disability adjusted life years (DALYs), a measure of overall disease burden that combines years of life lost due to premature mortality (under five-year mortality) and years lived with disability (stunting). Incremental cost effectiveness ratios were calculated using cost data from already published studies.
   Results
   By incrementing UFe60 (standard practice) to EMMS, one DALY could be averted at a cost of US$24.
   Conclusion
   When both favourable and unfavourable outcomes were included in the analysis, early prenatal food and multiple micronutrient interventions remained highly cost effective and seem to be meaningful from a public health perspective.

AB Shot-noise-limited Doppler-broadened (Db) noise-immune cavity-enhanced optical heterodyne molecular spectrometry (NICE-OHMS) has been realized by implementation of balanced detection. A characterization of the system based on Allan-Werle plots of the absorption coefficient, retrieved by fitting a model function to data, shows that the system has a white noise equivalent absorption per unit length per square root of bandwidth of 2.3 x 10(-13) cm(-1) Hz(-1/2), solely 44% above the shot noise limit, and a detection sensitivity of 2.2 x 10(-14) cm(-1) over 200 s, both being unprecedented for Db NICE-OHMS. The white noise response follows the expected inverse square root dependence on power that is representative of a shot-noise-limited response, which confirms that the system is shot-noise-limited.

AB The addition of Ca-containing compounds can reduce mass loss from agricultural biomass during storage. The resulting alkaline environment is detrimental to microorganisms present in the material. Theoretical analysis of Ca-containing biomass suggests that combustion properties are improved with respect to slagging. To validate the theoretical calculations, barley straw was utilized as a typical model agricultural biomass and combustion characteristics of straw pre-treated with 2 and 4 w/w% CaCO3 for combined improvement of storage and combustion properties were determined through combustion at 700 degrees C in a bench-scale bubbling fluidized-bed reactor (5 kW) using quartz and olivine sand as bed materials. The combustion characteristics were determined in terms of elemental composition and compound identification in bed ash and bed material including agglomerates, fly ash, particulate matter as well as flue gas measurements. The addition of CaCO3 to straw had both positive and negative effects on its combustion characteristics. Both additive levels raised the total de fluidization temperature for both quartz and olivine, and olivine proved to be less susceptible than quartz to reactions with alkali. With Ca-additives, the composition of deposits and fine particulate matter changed to include higher amounts of KCl potentially leading to higher risk for alkali chloride-induced corrosion. Flue gas composition was heavily influenced by CaCO3 additives by significantly elevated CO concentrations likely related to increased levels of gaseous alkali compounds. The results suggest that it is necessary to reduce gaseous alkali compounds, e.g. through kaolin or sulphur addition, if alkali-rich straw is to be co-combusted with Ca-rich biomass or large amounts of Ca-additives.

AB This study presents the effect of lignocellulosic compounds and monolignols on the yield, nanostructure and reactivity of soot generated at 1250 degrees C in a drop tube furnace. The structure of soot was characterized by electron microscopy techniques, Raman spectroscopy and electron spin resonance spectroscopy. The CO2 reactivity of soot was investigated by thermogravimetric analysis. Soot from cellulose was more reactive than soot produced from extractives, lignin and monolignols. Soot reactivity was correlated with the separation distances between adjacent graphene layers, as measured using transmission electron microscopy. Particle size, free radical concentration, differences in a degree of curvature and multi-core structures influenced the soot reactivity less than the interlayer separation distances. Soot yield was correlated with the lignin content of the feedstock. The selection of the extraction solvent had a strong influence on the soot reactivity. The Soxhlet extraction of softwood and wheat straw lignin soot using methanol decreased the soot reactivity, whereas acetone extraction had only a modest effect.

DE Spin glasses; Ising model; Hyperscaling
ID DIMENSION; EXPANSIONS; EXPONENT; MODEL
AB Among the Renormalization Group Theory scaling rules relating critical exponents, there are hyperscaling rules involving the dimension of the system. It is well known that in Ising models hyperscaling breaks down above the upper critical dimension. It was shown by Schwartz (1991) that the standard Josephson hyperscaling rule can also break down in Ising systems with quenched random interactions. A related Renormalization Group Theory hyperscaling rule links the critical exponents for the normalized Binder cumulant and the correlation length in the thermodynamic limit. An appropriate scaling approach for analyzing measurements from criticality to infinite temperature is first outlined. Numerical data on the scaling of the normalized correlation length and the normalized Binder cumulant are shown for the canonical Ising ferromagnet model in dimension three where hyperscaling holds, for the Ising ferromagnet in dimension five (so above the upper critical dimension) where hyperscaling breaks down, and then for Ising spin glass models in dimension three where the quenched interactions are random. For the Ising spin glasses there is a breakdown of the normalized Binder cumulant hyperscaling relation in the thermodynamic limit regime, with a return to size independent Binder cumulant values in the finite-size scaling regime around the critical region.

AB Mutations in the mitochondrially located protein CHCHD10 cause motoneuron disease by an unknown mechanism. In this study, we investigate the mutations p. R15L and p. G66V in comparison to wild-type CHCHD10 and the non-pathogenic variant p. P34S in vitro, in patient cells as well as in the vertebrate in vivo model zebrafish. We demonstrate a reduction of CHCHD10 protein levels in p. R15L and p. G66V mutant patient cells to approximately 50%. Quantitative real-time PCR revealed that expression of CHCHD10 p. R15L, but not of CHCHD10 p. G66V, is already abrogated at the mRNA level. Altered secondary structure and rapid protein degradation are observed with regard to the CHCHD10 p. G66V mutant. In contrast, no significant differences in expression, degradation rate or secondary structure of non-pathogenic CHCHD10 p. P34S are detected when compared with wild-type protein. Knockdown of CHCHD10 expression in zebrafish to about 50% causes motoneuron pathology, abnormal myofibrillar structure and motility deficits in vivo. Thus, our data show that the CHCHD10 mutations p. R15L and p. G66V cause motoneuron disease primarily based on haploinsufficiency of CHCHD10.

AB An increasing number of short-term laboratory studies on fish reports behavioral effects from exposure to aquatic contaminants or raised carbon dioxide levels affecting the GABA(A) receptor. However, how such GABAergic behavioral modifications (GBMs) impact populations in more complex natural systems is not known. In this study, we induced GBMs in European perch (Perca fluviatilis) via exposure to a GABA agonist (oxazepam) and followed the effects on growth and survival over one summer (70 days) in replicated pond ecosystems. We hypothesized that anticipated GBMs, expressed as anti-anxiety like behaviors (higher activity and boldness levels), that increase feeding rates in laboratory assays, would; i) increase growth and ii) increase mortality from predation. To test our hypotheses, 480 PIT tagged perch of known individual weights, and 12 predators (northern pike, Esox lucius) were evenly distributed in 12 ponds; six control (no oxazepam) and six spiked (15.5 +/- 4 mu g l(-1) oxazepam[ mean +/- 1 S.E.]) ponds. Contrary to our hypotheses, even though perch grew on average 16% more when exposed to oxazepam, we found no significant difference between exposed and control fish in growth (exposed: 3.9 +/- 1.2 g, control: 2.9 +/- 1 g [mean +/- 1 S.E.], respectively) or mortality (exposed: 26.5 +/- 1.8 individuals pond(-1), control: 24.5 +/- 2.6 individuals pond(-1), respectively). In addition, we show that reduced prey capture efficiency in exposed pike may explain the lack of significant differences in predation. Hence, our results suggest that GBMs, which in laboratory studies impact fish behavior, and subsequently also feeding rates, do not seem to generate strong effects on growth and predation-risk in more complex and resource limited natural environments.

AB Despite the increasing understanding of the magnitude and drivers of carbon gas emissions from inland waters, the relevance of water fluctuation and associated drying on their dynamics is rarely addressed. Here, we quantified CO2 and CH4 fluxes from a set of temporary ponds across seasons. The ponds were in all occasion net CO2 emitters irrespective of the presence or absence of water. While the CO2 fluxes were in the upper range of emissions for freshwater lentic systems, CH4 fluxes were mostly undetectable. Dry habitats substantially contributed to these emissions and were always a source of CO2, whereas inundated habitats acted either as a source or a sink of atmospheric CO2 along the year. Higher concentrations of coloured and humic organic matter in water and sediment were linked to higher CO2 emissions. Composition of the sediment microbial community was related both to dissolved organic matter concentration and composition, but we did not find a direct link with CO2 fluxes. The presence of methanogenic archaea in most ponds suggested the potential for episodic CH4 production and emission. Our results highlight the need for spatially and temporally inclusive approaches that consider the dry phases and habitats to characterize carbon cycling in temporary systems.

AB Self-assembly of semiconducting polymer chains during crystallization from a liquid or melt dictates to a large degree the electronic properties of the resulting solid film. However, it is still unclear how charge transport pathways are created during crystallization. Here, we performed complementary in situ electrical measurements and synchrotron grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXD), during slow cooling from the melt of highly regio-regular poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) films deposited on both graphene and on silicon. Two different charge transport mechanisms were identified, and were correlated to the difference in crystallites' orientations and overall amount of crystallites in the films on each surface as molecular self-assembly proceeded. On silicon, a weak charge transport was enabled as soon as the first edge-on lamellae formed, and further increased with the higher amount of crystallites (predominantly edge-on and randomly oriented lamellae) during cooling. On graphene however, the current remained low until a minimum amount of crystallites was reached, at which point interconnection of conducting units (face-on, randomly oriented lamellae and tie-chains) formed percolated conducting pathways across the film. This lead to a sudden rapid increase in current by approximate to 10 fold, and strongly enhanced charge transport, despite a much lower amount of crystallites than on silicon.

AB ObjectiveTo examine the safety and tolerability as well as the preliminary efficacy of arimoclomol, a heat shock protein co-inducer that promotes nascent protein folding, in patients with rapidly progressive SOD1 amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).MethodsThis was a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in which patients with rapidly progressive SOD1-mutant ALS were randomized 1:1 to receive arimoclomol 200 mg tid or matching placebo for up to 12 months. Study procedures were performed using a mix of in-person and remote assessments. Primary outcome was safety and tolerability. Secondary outcome was efficacy, with survival as the principal measure. Additional efficacy measures were the rates of decline of the Revised ALS Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS-R) and percent predicted forced expiratory volume in 6 seconds (FEV6), and the Combined Assessment of Function and Survival (CAFS).ResultsThirty-eight participants were randomized. Thirty-six (19 placebo, 17 arimoclomol) were included in the prespecified intent-to-treat analysis. Apart from respiratory function, groups were generally well-balanced at baseline. Adverse events occurred infrequently, and were usually mild and deemed unlikely or not related to study drug. Adjusting for riluzole and baseline ALSFRS-R, survival favored arimoclomol with a hazard ratio of 0.77 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.32-1.80). ALSFRS-R and FEV6 declined more slowly in the arimoclomol group, with treatment differences of 0.5 point/month (95% CI -0.63 to 1.63) and 1.24 percent predicted/month (95% CI -2.77 to 5.25), respectively, and the CAFS similarly favored arimoclomol.ConclusionsThis study provides Class II evidence that arimoclomol is safe and well-tolerated at a dosage of 200 mg tid for up to 12 months. Although not powered for therapeutic effect, the consistency of results across the range of prespecified efficacy outcome measures suggests a possible therapeutic benefit of arimoclomol.Clinicaltrials.gov identifierNCT00706147.Classification of evidenceThis study provides Class II evidence that arimoclomol is safe and well-tolerated at a dosage of 200 mg tid for up to 12 months. The study lacked the precision to conclude, or to exclude, an important therapeutic benefit of arimoclomol.

AB Background: Early retirement caused by disability pension (DP) due to common mental disorders (CMDs) is frequent in European countries. Inadequate treatment, e.g., suboptimal antidepressant (AD) medication before DP can be crucial in such DP. This explorative study aimed to disentangle trajectories of AD based on defined daily dose (DDD) before and after granted DP, and to characterize the trajectories by socio-demographics and medical factors.
   Methods: All 4642 individuals in Sweden aged 19-64 with incident DP due to CMD in 2009-2010 were included. Trajectories of annual DDDs of AD were analysed over a 6-year period by a group-based trajectory method. Associations between socio-demographic or medical factors and different trajectories were estimated by chi(2)-test and multinomial logistic regression.
   Results: Five trajectories of ADs were identified. Three groups, comprising 34%, 34%, and 21% of the cohort, had constant AD levels before and after DP with mean annual DDDs of 29, 234, and 580, respectively. Two groups, each including 6% of the cohort, had increasing levels of DDDs, levelling off at around 1150 and 785 DDDs after DP. Particularly age, outpatient care due to mental diagnoses and DP diagnoses were significantly associated with different trajectories (p < 0.05). All the groups had a larger proportion of older individuals (>50%, 45-64 years), except for the 'increasing low' group, where younger individuals were in majority (>60%, 18-44 years), who more frequently exited labour market due to 'anxiety disorders', with lower education and more specialised healthcare before DP than the other groups.
   Conclusion: The heterogeneity among the five trajectory groups was partly explained by age, the severity of the mental disorder and the DP diagnoses. DDDs of ADs, though on different levels, varied marginally before and after granted DP in the majority. Moreover, AD levels were very low in one third of the individuals. Early identification and focus on the 'increasing low' group might be important in order to identify individuals at risk for further increase in annual DDDs of ADs even after granted DP, and might also contribute in prevention of DP. Further detailed research regarding different groups is warranted.

AB Current global models of the carbon (C) cycle consider only vertical gas exchanges between terrestrial or oceanic reservoirs and the atmosphere, thus not considering the lateral transport of carbon from the continents to the oceans. Therefore, those models implicitly consider all of the C which is not respired to the atmosphere to be stored on land and hence overestimate the land C sink capability. A model that represents the whole continuum from atmosphere to land and into the ocean would provide a better understanding of the Earth's C cycle and hence more reliable historical or future projections. A first and critical step in that direction is to include processes representing the production and export of dissolved organic carbon in soils. Here we present an original representation of dissolved organic C (DOC) processes in the Joint UK Land Environment Simulator (JULES-DOCM) that integrates a representation of DOC production in terrestrial ecosystems based on the incomplete decomposition of organic matter, DOC decomposition within the soil column, and DOC export to the river network via leaching. The model performance is evaluated in five specific sites for which observations of soil DOC concentration are available. Results show that the model is able to reproduce the DOC concentration and controlling processes, including leaching to the riverine system, which is fundamental for integrating terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Future work should include the fate of exported DOC in the river system as well as DIC and POC export from soil.

AB The Lancet Countdown tracks progress on health and climate change and provides an independent assessment of the health effects of climate change, the implementation of the Paris Agreement, 1 and the health implications of these actions. It follows on from the work of the 2015 Lancet Commission on Health and Climate Change, 2 which concluded that anthropogenic climate change threatens to undermine the past 50 years of gains in public health, and conversely, that a comprehensive response to climate change could be "the greatest global health opportunity of the 21st century".
   The Lancet Countdown is a collaboration between 24 academic institutions and intergovernmental organisations based in every continent and with representation from a wide range of disciplines. The collaboration includes climate scientists, ecologists, economists, engineers, experts in energy, food, and transport systems, geographers, mathematicians, social and political scientists, public health professionals, and doctors. It reports annual indicators across five sections: climate change impacts, exposures, and vulnerability; adaptation planning and resilience for health; mitigation actions and health co-benefits; economics and finance; and public and political engagement.
   The key messages from the 40 indicators in the Lancet Countdown's 2017 report are summarised below.

AB The characterization and identification of compounds in complex real-world samples is quite difficult and new concepts and workflows are highly desirable. Retention indices (RIs) are widely used in gas chromatography (GC) to support the identification of unknown compounds. Several attempts have been made to introduce a similar concept for the second dimension in comprehensive two-dimensional (2D) GC (GC x GC) but, an easily applicable and robust system remains elusive.
   In the present study, a new RI system for GC x GC was developed. Polyethylene glycols (PEGs) were used in combination with a simple linear regression, with n-alkanes as reference points for virtually unretained compounds and PEG homologs as reference compounds for second-dimension Ris (PEG-I-2). The n-alkanes were assigned a PEG-I-2 of zero and the distance between consecutive PEG homologs from PEG-2 (diethylene glycol) and higher were assigned a PEG-I-2 value of 10. We used ethylene glycol and PEG 2 through PEG-10 as reference compounds, thereby covering a PEG-I-2 range from 20.0 for ethylene glycol, over 50.0 for diethylene glycol (PEG-2) to 130.0 for decaethylene glycol (PEG-10); additional PEGs can be added to cover a wider polarity range. The PEG-I-2 system was initially evaluated using a 30 m x 0.25 mm non-polar (5% phenyl, 0.25 mu m film thickness) first-dimension column and a 1.6 m x 0.18 mm polar (50% phenyl, 0.18 mu m film thickness) second-dimension column. This system was validated for use with non polar first-dimension columns and a semi-polar (50% phenyl) second-dimension column, and exhibited robustness to changes in the carrier gas flow velocity, oven temperature ramping rate, and secondary oven temperature offset. An average relative standard deviation of 2.7%, equal to a 95% confidence interval of 1.27 PEG-I-2 units, was obtained for the PEG-I-2 values of 72 environmental pollutants. Additionally, the system was found to be applicable over a wide range of boiling points (in the current case, from n-heptane to n-dotriacontane (C-7-C-32)) and can be used with various column dimensions. Changing the second-dimension column to either a narrower 0.1 mm column or a wider 0.25 mm column, yielded similar 95%-percentiles to that of the 0.18 mm column, differing by only 3.20 and 2.80 PEG-I-2 units, respectively. Moreover, methods for improving the system were suggested. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objective
   To subgroup chronic pain patients using psychometric data and regress the variables most responsible for subgroup discrimination.
   Design
   Cross-sectional, registry-based study.
   Setting and subjects
   Chronic pain patients assessed at a multidisciplinary pain centre between 2008 and 2015.
   Methods
   Data from the Swedish quality registry for pain rehabilitation (SQRP) were retrieved and analysed by principal component analysis, hierarchical clustering analysis, and partial least squares-discriminant analysis.
   Results
   Four subgroups were identified. Group 1 was characterized by low "psychological strain", the best relative situation concerning pain characteristics (intensity and spreading), the lowest frequency of fibromyalgia, as well as by a slightly older age. Group 2 was characterized by high "psychological strain" and by the most negative situation with respect to pain characteristics (intensity and spreading). Group 3 was characterized by high "social distress", the longest pain durations, and a statistically higher frequency of females. The frequency of three neuropathic pain conditions was generally lower in this group. Group 4 was characterized by high psychological strain, low "social distress", and high pain intensity.
   Conclusions
   The identification of these four clusters of chronic pain patients could be useful for the development of personalized rehabilitation programs. For example, the identification of a subgroup characterized mainly by high perceived "social distress" raises the question of how to best design interventions for such patients. Differentiating between clinically important subgroups and comparing how these subgroups respond to interventions is arguably an important area for further research.

AB Objective
   To investigate changes in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) immunological profile after treatment switch from first-line injectables to rituximab in patients with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS), and to compare the profile in MS patients with healthy controls (HC).
   Method
   Cerebrospinal fluid from 70 patients with clinically stable RRMS and 55 HC was analysed by a multiplex electrochemiluminescence method for a broad panel of cytokines and immunoactive substances before, and over a two-year period after, treatment switch to rituximab. After quality assessment of data, using a predefined algorithm, 14 analytes were included in the final analysis.
   Results
   Ten of the 14 analytes differed significantly in MS patients compared with HC at baseline. Levels of IP-10 (CXCL10), IL-12/23p40, IL-6, sVCAM1, IL-15, sICAM1 and IL-8 (CXCL8) decreased significantly after treatment switch to rituximab. The cytokines IP-10 and IL-12/IL-23p40 displayed the largest difference versus HC at baseline and also the largest relative reduction after therapy switch to rituximab.
   Conclusion
   We found significant changes in the immunological profile after therapy switch to rituximab in RRMS in the direction towards the values of HC. IP-10 and IL12/IL-23p40 deserve further studies as part of the immunopathogenesis of MS as well as for the mode of action of rituximab in MS.

AB Background: The challenges of today's society call for more knowledge about how to maintain all aspects of cognitive health, such as speed/attention, memory/learning, visuospatial ability, language, executive capacity and social cognition during the life course.
   Main text: Medical advances have improved treatments of numerous diseases, but the cognitive implications have not been sufficiently addressed. Disability induced by cognitive dysfunction is also a major issue in groups of patients not suffering from Alzheimer's disease or related disorders. Recent studies indicate that several negative lifestyle factors can contribute to the development of cognitive impairment, but intervention and prevention strategies have not been implemented. Disability due to cognitive failure among the workforce has become a major challenge. Globally, the changing aging pyramid results in increased prevalence of cognitive disorders, and the diversity of cultures influences the expression, manifestation and consequences of cognitive dysfunction.
   Conclusions: Major tasks in the field of cognitive medicine are basic neuroscience research to uncover diverse disease mechanisms, determinations of the prevalence of cognitive dysfunction, health-economical evaluations, and intervention studies. Raising awareness for cognitive medicine as a clinical topic would also highlight the importance of specialized health care units for an integrative approach to the treatment of cognitive dysfunctions.

   DEPRIVATION; PATHWAY; GLIOMA; ASPARAGINASE; MESOTHELIOMA
AB Background: Tumour cells have a high demand for arginine. However, a subset of glioblastomas has a defect in the arginine biosynthetic pathway due to epigenetic silencing of the rate limiting enzyme argininosuccinate synthetase (ASS1). These tumours are auxotrophic for arginine and susceptible to the arginine degrading enzyme, pegylated arginine deiminase (ADI-PEG20). Moreover, ASS1 deficient GBM have a worse prognosis compared to ASS1 positive tumours. Since altered tumour metabolism is one of the hallmarks of cancer we were interested to determine if these two subtypes exhibited different metabolic profiles that could allow for their non-invasive detection as well as unveil additional novel therapeutic opportunities.
   Methods: We looked for basal metabolic differences using one and two-dimensional gas chromatography-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (1D/2DGC-TOFMS) followed by targeted analysis of 29 amino acids using liquid chromatography-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-TOFMS). We also looked for differences upon arginine deprivation in a single ASS1 negative and positive cell line (SNB19 and U87 respectively). The acquired data was evaluated by chemometric based bioinformatic methods.
   Results: Orthogonal partial least squares-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) of both the 1D and 2D GC-TOFMS data revealed significant systematic difference in metabolites between the two subgroups with ASS1 positive cells generally exhibiting an overall elevation of identified metabolites, including those involved in the arginine biosynthetic pathway. Pathway and network analysis of the metabolite profile show that ASS1 negative cells have altered arginine and citrulline metabolism as well as altered amino acid metabolism. As expected, we observed significant metabolite perturbations in ASS negative cells in response to ADI-PEG20 treatment.
   Conclusions: This study has highlighted significant differences in the metabolome of ASS1 negative and positive GBM which warrants further study to determine their diagnostic and therapeutic potential for the treatment of this devastating disease.

AB Background: The evidence supporting the use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in prostate cancer detection has been established, but its accuracy in local staging is questioned.
   Purpose: To investigate the additional value of multi-planar radial reconstructions of a three-dimensional (3D) T2-weighted (T2W) MRI sequence, intercepting the prostate capsule perpendicularly, for improving local staging of prostate cancer.
   Material and Methods: Preoperative, bi-parametric prostate MRI examinations in 94 patients operated between June 2014 and January 2015 where retrospectively reviewed by two experienced abdominal radiologists. Each patient was presented in two separate sets including diffusion-weighted imaging, without and with the 3D T2W set that included radial reconstructions. Each set was read at least two months apart. Extraprostatic tumor extension (EPE) was assessed according to a 5-point grading scale. Sensitivity and specificity for EPE was calculated and presented as receiver operating characteristics (ROC) with area under the curve (AUC), using histology from whole-mount prostate specimen as gold standard. Inter-rater agreement was calculated for the two different reading modes using Cohen's kappa.
   Results: The AUC for detection of EPE for Readers 1 and 2 in the two-dimensional (2D) set was 0.70 and 0.68, respectively, and for the 2D+3D set 0.62 and 0.65, respectively. Inter-rater agreement (Reader 1 vs. Reader 2) on EPE using Cohen's kappa for the 2D and 2D+3D set, respectively, was 0.42 and 0.17 (i.e. moderate and poor agreement, respectively).
   Conclusion: The addition of 3D T2W MRI with radial reconstructions did not improve local staging in prostate cancer.

AB In 2020, 146,063 deaths due to pancreatic cancer are estimated to occur in Europe and the United States combined. To identify common susceptibility alleles, we performed the largest pancreatic cancer GWAS to date, including 9040 patients and 12,496 controls of European ancestry from the Pancreatic Cancer Cohort Consortium (PanScan) and the Pancreatic Cancer Case-Control Consortium (PanC4). Here, we find significant evidence of a novel association at rs78417682 (7p12/TNS3, P = 4.35 x 10(-8)). Replication of 10 promising signals in up to 2737 patients and 4752 controls from the PANcreatic Disease ReseArch (PAN-DoRA) consortium yields new genome-wide significant loci: rs13303010 at 1p36.33 (NOC2L, P = 8.36 x 10(-14)), rs2941471 at 8q21.11 (HNF4G, P = 6.60 x 10(-10)), rs4795218 at 17q12 (HNF1B, P = 1.32 x 10(-8)), and rs1517037 at 18q21.32 (GRP, P = 3.28 x 10(-8)). rs78417682 is not statistically significantly associated with pancreatic cancer in PANDoRA. Expression quantitative trait locus analysis in three independent pancreatic data sets provides molecular support of NOC2L as a pancreatic cancer susceptibility gene.

AB Background: Lithium remains first choice as maintenance treatment for bipolar affective disorder. Yet, about half of all individuals may stop their treatment at some point, despite lithium's proven benefits concerning the prevention of severe affective episodes and suicide.
   Methods: Retrospective cohort study in the Swedish region of Norrbotten into the causes of lithium discontinuation. The study was set up to (1) test whether patients with bipolar affective disorder or schizoaffective disorder, treated with lithium maintenance therapy, were more likely to discontinue lithium because of adverse effects than lack of therapeutic effectiveness, (2) explore gender differences, (3) understand the role of diagnosis and (4) identify who, patient or doctor, took the initiative to stop lithium. Review of medical records for all episodes of lithium discontinuation that had occurred between 1997 and 2013 with the intent to stop lithium for good.
   Results: Of 873 patients treated with lithium, 54% discontinued lithium, corresponding to 561 episodes of lithium discontinuation. In 62% of episodes, lithium was discontinued due to adverse effects, in 44% due to psychiatric reasons, and in 12% due to physical reasons interfering with lithium treatment. The five single most common adverse effects leading to lithium discontinuation were diarrhoea (13%), tremor (11%), polyuria/polydipsia/diabetes insipidus (9%), creatinine increase (9%) and weight gain (7%). Women were as likely as men to take the initiative to stop lithium, but twice as likely to consult a doctor before taking action (p < 0.01). Patients with type 1 BPAD or SZD were more likely to discontinue lithium than patients with type 2 or unspecified BPAD (p < 0.01). Patients with type 1 BPAD or SZD were more likely to refuse medication (p < 0.01). Conversely, patients with type 2 or unspecified BPAD were three times as likely to discontinue lithium for lack or perceived lack of effectiveness (p < 0.001).
   Conclusions: Stopping lithium treatment is common and occurs mostly due to adverse effects. It is important to discuss potential adverse effects with patients before initiation and continuously during lithium treatment, to reduce the frequency of potentially unnecessary discontinuations.

The photovoltaic properties of M-1-M-3 and M-4-M-6 are compared with standard RaRc and R-b,R-d respectively. Geometry optimization was performed with CAM-B3LYP/6-31G (d) level of theory. TD-CAM-B3LYP has been employed for the estimation of excited state properties of the molecules. M-1, M-2, M-3 and M-4, M-5, M-6 symbolized suitable frontier molecular orbital's (FMO's) energy levels with broad absorption spectra. The electron withdrawing substituents impart red shift in absorption spectra along with good consistancy of designed donor molecules. Reorganization energies of donor molecules (M-1-M-6) showed ideal properties of charge mobility. M-1 and M-4 illustrated lowest le values as compared to lambda(h), thus dictated that designed donor molecules are of good choice for their electron donating ability. Furthermore, M-2 and M-6 demonstrated shortest Eg of 3.7 and 3.72 eV among HOMO and LUMO energy levels.

AB Cell-mediated immunity (CMI) is normally required for efficient protection against intracellular infections, however, identification of correlates is challenging and they are generally lacking. Francisella tularensis is a highly virulent, facultative intracellular bacterium and CMI is critically required for protection against the pathogen, but how this is effectuated in humans is poorly understood. To understand the protective mechanisms, we established an in vitro co-culture assay to identify how control of infection of F. tularensis is accomplished by human cells and hypothesized that the model will mimic in vivo immune mechanisms. Non-adherent peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were expanded with antigen and added to cultures with adherent PBMC infected with the human vaccine strain, LVS, or the highly virulent SCHU S4 strain. Intracellular numbers of F. tularensis was followed for 72 h and secreted and intracellular cytokines were analyzed. Addition of PBMC expanded from naive individuals, i.e., those with no record of immunization to F. tularensis, generally resulted in little or no control of intracellular bacterial growth, whereas addition of PBMC from a majority of F. tularensis-immune individuals executed static and sometimes cidal effects on intracellular bacteria. Regardless of infecting strain, statistical differences between the two groups were significant, P < 0.05. Secretion of 11 cytokines was analyzed after 72 h of infection and significant differences with regard to secretion of IFN-gamma, TNF, and MIP-1 beta was observed between immune and naive individuals for LVS-infected cultures. Also, in LVS-infected cultures, CD4 T cells from vaccinees, but not CD8 T cells, showed significantly higher expression of IFN-gamma, MIP-1 beta, TNF, and CD107a than cells from naive individuals. The co-culture system appears to identify correlates of immunity that are relevant for the understanding of mechanisms of the protective host immunity to F. tularensis.

AB In this study, we examined the photodegradation of decabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-209) on the surface of car seat covers from end-of-life vehicles (ELVs). Samples were collected at two car dismantling facilities in Sweden and cover car models from 1989 to 1998. The content of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) in nine real samples (fabric and polyurethane foam) was first characterized. Fabric samples that did not contain BDE-209 were then spiked with BDE-209 and irradiated in the laboratory and under sunlight. Photoproducts were identified using high performance liquid chromatography coupled to electrospray ionization mass spectrometer (HPLC-ESI-Orbitrap-MS), whereas volatile products were analyzed by gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Similar photodegradation rates and oxidation products were observed in fabric samples irradiated in the laboratory and those collected from ELVs. Estimated half-life of BDE-209 on fabric inside vehicles ranged from 3 to 6 years. Thirteen major photoproducts were identified as lower brominated products, hydroxylated BDEs, brominated and hydroxylated dibenzofurans (PBDFs) and dioxins (PBDDs). Furthermore, several photoproducts were found to be transferable into water, particularly bromophenols and hydroxylated BDEs, and others into gas phase, such as bromomethanol and 1,2-dibromoethane. This should be taken into consideration for better estimating exposure to PBDEs and to develop strategies for ELV recycling.

AB Purpose: Shared decision making, SDM, in psychiatric services, supports users to experience a greater sense of involvement in treatment, self-efficacy, autonomy and reduced coercion. Decision tools adapted to the needs of users have the potential to support SDM and restructure how users and staff work together to arrive at shared decisions.
   The aim of this study was to describe and analyse the implementation process of an SDM intervention for users of psychiatric services in Sweden. Method: The implementation was studied through a process evaluation utilizing both quantitative and qualitative methods. In designing the process evaluation for the intervention, three evaluation components were emphasized: contextual factors, implementation issues and mechanisms of impact.
   Results: The study addresses critical implementation issues related to decision-making authority, the perceived decision-making ability of users and the readiness of the service to increase influence and participation. It also emphasizes the importance of facilitation, as well as suggesting contextual adaptations that may be relevant for the local organizations.
   Conclusion: The results indicate that staff perceived the decision support tool as user-friendly and useful in supporting participation in decision-making, and suggest that such concrete supports to participation can be a factor in implementation if adequate attention is paid to organizational contexts and structures.

   model
SO VETERINARY RESEARCH

ID GENE-EXPRESSION; PATHOGEN; PROTEIN; CELLS; PRFA
AB Most human listeriosis outbreaks are caused by Listeria monocytogenes evolutionary lineage I strains which possess four exotoxins: a phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PlcA), a broad-range phospholipase C (PlcB), listeriolysin O (LLO) and listeriolysin S (LLS). The simultaneous contribution of these molecules to virulence has never been explored. Here, the importance of these four exotoxins of an epidemic lineage I L. monocytogenes strain (F2365) in virulence was assessed in chicken embryos infected in the allantoic cavity. We show that LLS does not play a role in virulence while LLO is required to infect and kill chicken embryos both in wild type transcriptional regulator of virulence PrfA -(PrfAWT) and constitutively active PrfA (PrfA*) backgrounds. We demonstrate that PlcA, a toxin previously considered as a minor virulence factor, played a major role in virulence in a PrfA* background. Interestingly, GFP transcriptional fusions show that the plcA promoter is less active than the hly promoter in vitro, explaining why the contribution of PlcA to virulence could be observed more importantly in a PrfA* background. Together, our results suggest that PlcA might play a more important role in the infectious lifecycle of L. monocytogenes than previously thought, explaining why all the strains of L. monocytogenes have conserved an intact copy of plcA in their genomes.

AB To examine for a causal relationship between vitamin D and glioma risk we performed an analysis of genetic variants associated with serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH) D) levels using Mendelian randomisation (MR), an approach unaffected by biases from confounding. Two-sample MR was undertaken using genome-wide association study data. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with 25(OH) D levels were used as instrumental variables (IVs). We calculated MR estimates for the odds ratio (OR) for 25(OH) D levels with glioma using SNP-glioma estimates from 12,488 cases and 18,169 controls, using inverse-variance weighted (IVW) and maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) methods. A non-significant association between 25(OH) D levels and glioma risk was shown using both the IVW (OR = 1.21, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.90-1.62, P = 0.201) and MLE (OR = 1.20, 95% CI = 0.98-1.48, P = 0.083) methods. In an exploratory analysis of tumour subtype, an inverse relationship between 25(OH)D levels and glioblastoma (GBM) risk was identified using the MLE method (OR = 0.62, 95% CI = 0.43-0.89, P = 0.010), but not the IVW method (OR = 0.62, 95% CI = 0.37-1.04, P = 0.070). No statistically significant association was shown between 25(OH) D levels and non-GBM glioma. Our results do not provide evidence for a causal relationship between 25(OH) D levels and all forms of glioma risk. More evidence is required to explore the relationship between 25(OH) D levels and risk of GBM.

TI ORCHIDEE-PEAT (revision 4596), a model for northern peatland CO2, water,

AB Peatlands store substantial amounts of carbon and are vulnerable to climate change. We present a modified version of the Organising Carbon and Hydrology In Dynamic Ecosystems (ORCHIDEE) land surface model for simulating the hydrology, surface energy, and CO2 fluxes of peatlands on daily to annual timescales. The model includes a separate soil tile in each 0.5 degrees grid cell, defined from a global peatland map and identified with peat-specific soil hydraulic properties. Runoff from non-peat vegetation within a grid cell containing a fraction of peat is routed to this peat soil tile, which maintains shallow water tables. The water table position separates oxic from anoxic decomposition. The model was evaluated against eddy-covariance (EC) observations from 30 northern peatland sites, with the maximum rate of carboxylation (V-cmax) being optimized at each site. Regarding short-term day-to-day variations, the model performance was good for gross primary production (GPP) (r(2) = 0.76; Nash-Sutcliffe modeling efficiency, MEF = 0.76) and ecosystem respiration (ER, r(2) = 0.78, MEF = 0.75), with lesser accuracy for latent heat fluxes (LE, r(2) = 0.42, MEF = 0.14) and and net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE, r(2) = 0.38, MEF = 0.26). Seasonal variations in GPP, ER, NEE, and energy fluxes on monthly scales showed moderate to high r(2) values (0.57-0.86). For spatial across-site gradients of annual mean GPP, ER, NEE, and LE, r(2) values of 0.93, 0.89, 0.27, and 0.71 were achieved, respectively. Water table (WT) variation was not well predicted (r(2) < 0.1), likely due to the uncertain water input to the peat from surrounding areas. However, the poor performance of WT simulation did not greatly affect predictions of ER and NEE. We found a significant relationship between optimized V-cmax and latitude (temperature), which better reflects the spatial gradients of annual NEE than using an average V-cmax value.

AB Background: Genital Chlamydia trachomatis infection is a major public health problem worldwide affecting mostly youth. Sweden introduced an opportunistic screening approach in 1982 accompanied by treatment, partner notification and case reporting. After an initial decline in infection rate till the mid-90s, the number of reported cases has increased over the last two decades and has now stabilized at a high level of 37,000 reported cases in Sweden per year (85% of cases in youth). Sexual risk-taking among youth is also reported to have significantly increased over the last 20 years. Mobile health (mHealth) interventions could be particularly suitable for youth and sexual health promotion as the intervention is delivered in a familiar and discrete way to a tech savvy at-risk population. This paper presents a protocol for a randomized trial to study the effect of an interactive mHealth application (app) on condom use among the youth of Stockholm.
   Methods: 446 youth resident in Stockholm, will be recruited in this two arm parallel group individually randomized trial. Recruitment will be from Youth Health Clinics or via the trial website. Participants will be randomized to receive either the intervention (which comprises an interactive app on safe sexual health that will be installed on their smart phones) or a control group (standard of care). Youth will be followed up for 6 months, with questionnaire responses submitted periodically via the app. Self-reported condom use over 6 months will be the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes will include presence of an infection, Chlamydia tests during the study period and proxy markers of safe sex. Analysis is by intention to treat.
   Discussion: This trial exploits the high mobile phone usage among youth to provide a phone app intervention in the area of sexual health. If successful, the results will have implications for health service delivery and health promotion among the youth. From a methodological perspective, this trial is expected to provide information on the strength and challenges of implementing a partially app (internet) based trial in this context.

However, studies evaluating intervention and policies on a mode shift from motorized transport to cycling have estimated health impacts with varying validity and precision.
   Objective: To review and discuss the estimation of air pollution exposure and its impacts in health impact assessment studies of a shift in transport from cars to bicycles in order to guide future assessments.
   Methods: A systematic database search of PubMed was done primarily for articles published from January 2000 to May 2016 according to PRISMA guidelines.
   Results: We identified 18 studies of health impact assessment of change in transport mode. Most studies investigated future hypothetical scenarios of increased cycling. The impact on the general population was estimated using a comparative risk assessment approach in the majority of these studies, whereas some used previously published cost estimates. Air pollution exposure during cycling was estimated based on the ventilation rate, the pollutant concentration, and the trip duration. Most studies employed exposure-response functions from studies comparing background levels of fine particles between cities to estimate the health impacts of local traffic emissions. The effect of air pollution associated with increased cycling contributed small health benefits for the general population, and also only slightly increased risks associated with fine particle exposure among those who shifted to cycling. However, studies calculating health impacts based on exposure-response functions for ozone, black carbon or nitrogen oxides found larger effects attributed to changes in air pollution exposure.
   Conclusion: A large discrepancy between studies was observed due to different health impact assessment approaches, different assumptions for calculation of inhaled dose and different selection of dose-response functions. This kind of assessments would improve from more holistic approaches using more specific exposure- response functions.

AB Traditional sources of protein in fish feed for salmonids, such as fishmeal, face sustainability problems. Therefore, ingredients not attractive for human consumption are increasingly being considered for the development of future feeds. However, it is uncertain how this alternative range of ingredients will affect fish growth, quality and consumer opinion. In this experimental study, we tested a new fish feed on Arctic charr, containing a protein mixture from the Baltic Sea and yeast, all ingredients unattractive for human consumption. This feed comprised of sprat (Sprattus sprattus) and herring (Clupea harengus), blue mussels (Mytilus edulis) and baker's yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), in a ratio of three parts to the whole. Fish fed with this feed grew 11.5% less than the control group. The digestibility and microscopy analysis of the faeces suggested a lower digestibility of the test feed, presumably caused by the fish's inability to utilize the nutrients from the yeast cells. Consumers' perceptions of the final product were evaluated through a sensory evaluation, indicating no differences in scores of fillet quality between the two treatments. Potential implications of these results are discussed in context of feed composition, quality and other factors including species biology and season, which are relevant topics in the discussions on feed sustainability. Statement of relevance: Evaluating a feed mix unattractive for human consumption.

AB Proteolysis plays an important role in mitochondria! biogenesis, from the processing of newly imported precursor proteins to the degradation of mitochondrial targeting peptides. Disruption of peptide degradation activity in yeast, plant and mammalian mitochondria is known to have deleterious consequences for organism physiology, highlighting the important role of mitochondrial peptidases. In the present work, we show that the human mitochondrial peptidase neurolysin (hNLN) can degrade mitochondrial presequence peptides as well as other fragments up to 19 amino acids long. The crystal structure of hNLN(E475Q) in complex with the products of neurotensin cleavage at 2.7 angstrom revealed a closed conformation with an internal cavity that restricts substrate length and highlighted the mechanism of enzyme opening/closing that is necessary for substrate binding and catalytic activity. Analysis of peptide degradation in vitro showed that hNLN cooperates with presequence protease (PreP or PITRM1) in the degradation of long targeting peptides and amyloid-beta peptide, A beta 1-40, associated with Alzheimer disease, particularly cleaving the hydrophobic fragment A beta 35-40. These findings suggest that a network of proteases may be required for complete degradation of peptides localized in mitochondria. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Cell therapy has been shown to be a key clinical therapeutic option for central nervous system diseases or damage. Standardization of clinical cell therapy procedures is an important task for professional associations devoted to cell therapy. The Chinese Branch of the International Association of Neurorestoratology (IANR) completed the first set of guidelines governing the clinical application of neurorestoration in 2011. The IANR and the Chinese Association of Neurorestoratology (CANR) collaborated to propose the current version "Clinical Cell Therapy Guidelines for Neurorestoration (IANR/CANR 2017)". The IANR council board members and CANR committee members approved this proposal on September 1, 2016, and recommend it to clinical practitioners of cellular therapy. These guidelines include items of cell type nomenclature, cell quality control, minimal suggested cell doses, patient-informed consent, indications for undergoing cell therapy, contraindications for undergoing cell therapy, documentation of procedure and therapy, safety evaluation, efficacy evaluation, policy of repeated treatments, do not charge patients for unproven therapies, basic principles of cell therapy, and publishing responsibility.

AB Low visibility on expressways caused by heavy fog and haze is a main reason for traffic accidents. Real-time estimation of atmospheric visibility is an effective way to reduce traffic accident rates. With the development of computer technology, estimating atmospheric visibility via computer vision becomes a research focus. However, the estimation accuracy should be enhanced since fog and haze are complex and time-varying. In this paper, a total bounded variation (TBV) approach to estimate low visibility (less than 300 m) is introduced. Surveillance images of fog and haze are processed as blurred images (pse udo-blurred images), while the surveillance images at selected road points on sunny days are handled as clear images, when considering fog and haze as noise superimposed on the clear images. By combining image spectrum and TBV, the features of foggy and hazy images can be extracted. The extraction results are compared with features of images on sunny days. Firstly, the low visibility surveillance images can be filtered out according to spectrum features of foggy and hazy images. For foggy and hazy images with visibility less than 300 m, the high-frequency coefficient ratio of Fourier (discrete cosine) transform is less than 20%, while the low-frequency coefficient ratio is between 100% and 120%. Secondly, the relationship between TBV and real visibility is established based on machine learning and piecewise stationary time series analysis. The established piecewise function can be used for visibility estimation. Finally, the visibility estimation approach proposed is validated based on real surveillance video data. The validation results are compared with the results of image contrast model. Besides, the big video data are collected from the Tongqi expressway, Jiangsu, China. A total of 1,782,000 frames were used and the relative errors of the approach proposed are less than 10%.

AB Recently, a genome-wide association study showed that a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) -rs11706832-in intron 2 of the human LRIG1 (Leucine-rich repeats and immunoglobulin-like domains 1) gene is associated with susceptibility to glioma. However, the mechanism by which rs11706832 affects glioma risk remains unknown; additionally, it is unknown whether the expression levels of LRIG1 are a relevant determinant of gliomagenesis. Here, we investigated the role of Lrig1 in platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-induced experimental glioma in mice by introducing mono-allelic and bi-allelic deletions of Lrig1 followed by inducing gliomagenesis via intracranial retroviral transduction of PDGFB in neural progenitor cells. Lrig1 was expressed in PDGFB-induced gliomas in wild-type mice as assessed using in situ hybridization. Intriguingly, Lrig1-heterozygous mice developed higher grade gliomas than did wild-type mice (grade IV vs. grade II/III, p = 0.002). Reciprocally, the ectopic expression of LRIG1 in the TB107 highgrade human glioma (glioblastoma, grade IV) cell line decreased the invasion of orthotopic tumors in immunocompromised mice in vivo and reduced cell migration in vitro. Concomitantly, the activity of the receptor tyrosine kinase MET was downregulated, which partially explained the reduction in cell migration. In summary, Lrig1 is a haploinsufficient suppressor of PDGFB-driven glioma, possibly in part via negative regulation of MET-driven cell migration and invasion. Thus, for the first time, changes in physiological Lrig1 expression have been linked to gliomagenesis, whereby the SNP rs11706832 may affect glioma risk by regulating LRIG1 expression.

AB Objective: Underground mining is associated with obvious risks that can lead to mass casualty incidents. Information about such incidents was analyzed in an integrated literature review.
   Methods: A literature search (1980-2015) identified 564 modern-era underground mining reports from countries sharing similar occupational health legislation. These reports were condensed to 31 reports after consideration of quality grading and appropriateness to the aim. The Haddon matrix was used for structure, separating human factors from technical and environmental details, and timing.
   Results: Most of the reports were descriptive regarding injury-creating technical and environmental factors. The influence of rock characteristics was an important pre-event environmental factor. The organic nature of coal adds risks not shared in hard-rock mines. A sequence of mechanisms is commonly described, often initiated by a human factor in interaction with technology and step-wise escalation to involve environmental circumstances. Socioeconomic factors introduce heterogeneity. In the Haddon matrix, emergency medical services are mainly a post-event environmental issue, which were not well described in the available literature. The US Quecreek Coal Mine incident of 2002 stands out as a well-planned rescue mission.
   Conclusion: Evaluation of the preparedness to handle underground mining incidents deserves further scientific attention. Preparedness must include the medical aspects of rescue operations.

AB Aims: The aim was to investigate the time trends in educational, occupational, and income-related inequalities in leisure time physical inactivity in 2006, 2010, and 2014 in northern Swedish women and men. Methods: This study was based on data obtained from the repeated cross-sectional Health on Equal Terms survey of 2006, 2010, and 2014. The analytical sample consisted of 20,667 (2006), 31,787 (2010), and 21,613 (2014) individuals, aged 16-84. Logistic regressions were used to model the probability of physical inactivity given a set of explanatory variables. Slope index of inequality (SII) and relative index of inequality (RII) were used as summary measures of the social gradient in physical inactivity. The linear trend in inequalities and difference between gender and years were estimated by interaction analyses. Results: The year 2010 displayed the highest physical inactivity inequalities for all socioeconomic position indicators, but educational and occupational inequalities decreased in 2014. However, significant positive linear trends were found in absolute and relative income inequalities. Moreover, women had significantly higher RII of education in physical inactivity in 2014 and significantly higher SII and RII of income in physical inactivity in 2010, than did men in the same years. Conclusions: The recent reduction in educational and occupational inequalities following the high inequalities around the time of the great recession in 2010 suggests that the current policies might be fairly effective. However, to eventually alleviate inequities in physical inactivity, the focus of the researchers and policymakers should be directed toward the widening trends of income inequalities in physical inactivity.

AB The aim of this study was to investigate differences/similarities in dietary habits and eating practices between younger and older, rural and urban South African adolescents in specific environments (home, community and school) and their associations with overweight and obesity. Dietary habits, eating practices, and anthropometric measurements were performed on rural (n = 392, mean age = 13 years) and urban (n = 3098, mean age = 14 years) adolescents. Logistic regression analysis was used to examine the associations between dietary habits and eating practices, with overweight and obesity risk. Differences in dietary habits and eating practices by gender and by site within the three environments were identified. After adjusting for gender, site, dietary habits, and eating practices within the home, community and school environment, eating the main meal with family some days (OR = 1.78, 95% CI = 1.114-2.835; p <= 0.02), eating the main meal with family almost every day (OR = 1.61, 95% CI = 1.106-2.343; p <= 0.01), and irregular frequency of consuming breakfast on weekdays (OR = 1.38, 95% CI = 1.007-1.896; p 0.05) were all associated with increased risk of overweight and obesity. For "Year 15" adolescents, irregular frequency of consuming breakfast on weekends within the home environment (OR = 1.53, 95% CI = 1.099-2.129, p <= 0.01), was associated with increased risk of overweight and obesity. For both early- and mid-adolescents, being male (OR = 0.401, 95% CI = 0.299-0.537; p <= 0.00; OR = 0.29, 95% CI = 0.218-0.397; p <= 0.00) was associated with reduced risk of overweight and obesity, while residing in a rural setting (OR = 0.55, 95% CI = 0.324-0.924; p <= 0.02) was associated with reduced risk of overweight and obesity only among early-adolescents. Only dietary habits and eating practices within the home environment were associated with increased risk of overweight and obesity.

AB This paper explores the enormous variation in views, championing behaviours and impacts of liaison people: staff nominated to facilitate, tailor and promote SPIRIT (a research utilisation intervention trial in six Australian health policy agencies). Liaison people made cost/benefit analyses: they weighed the value of participation against its risks and demands in the context of organisational goals, knowledge utilisation norms, epistemology and leadership support. There was a degree of self-fulfilment (organisations got what they put in), but SPIRIT could not always be tailored to address local knowledge needs. We present nine propositions for identifying and supporting liaison people in similar interventions.

AB Multispectral Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) is a new technology and its output data have not been fully explored for tree species classification purposes. The objective of this study was to investigate what type of features from multispectral ALS data (wavelengths of 1550 nm, 1064 nm and 532 nm) are best suited for tree species classification. Remote sensing data were gathered over hemi-boreal forest in southern Sweden (58 degrees 2718.35N, 13 degrees 398.03E) on 21 July 2016. The field data consisted of 179 solitary trees from nine genera and ten species. Two new methods for feature extraction were tested and compared to features of height and intensity distributions. The features that were most important for tree species classification were intensity distribution features. Features from the upper part of the upper and outer parts of the crown were better for classification purposes than others. The best classification model was created using distribution features of both intensity and height in multispectral data, with a leave-one-out cross-validated accuracy of 76.5%. As a comparison, only structural features resulted in an highest accuracy of 43.0%. Picea abies and Pinus sylvestris had high user's and producer's accuracies and were not confused with any deciduous species. Tilia cordata was the deciduous species with a large sample that was most frequently confused with many other deciduous species. The results, although based on a small and special data set, suggest that multispectral ALS is a technology with great potential for tree species classification.

AB Apparent net uptake of carbon dioxide (CO2) during wintertime by an approximate to 90year old Scots pine stand in northern Sweden led us to conduct canopy decoupling and subcanopy advection investigations over an entire year. Eddy covariance (EC) measurements ran simultaneously above and within the forest canopy for that purpose. We used the correlation of above- and below-canopy standard deviation of vertical wind speed (sigma(w)) as decoupling indicator. We identified 0.33ms(-1) and 0.06ms(-1) as site-specific sigma(w) thresholds for above- and below-canopy coupling during nighttime (global radiation <20Wm(-2)) and 0.23ms(-1) and 0.06ms(-1) as daytime (global radiation >20Wm(-2)) sigma(w) thresholds. Decoupling occurred in 53% of the annual nighttime and 14% of the annual daytime. The annual net ecosystem exchange (NEE), gross ecosystem exchange (GEE), and ecosystem respiration (R-eco) derived via two-level filtered EC data were -357gCm(-2), -1,138gCm(-2), and 781gCm(-2), respectively. In comparison, both single-level friction velocity (u(*)) and quality filtering resulted in similar to 22% higher NEE, mainly caused by similar to 16% lower R-eco. GEE remained similar among filtering regimes. Accounting for changes of CO2 storage across the canopy in the single-level filtered data could only marginally decrease these discrepancies. Consequently, advection appears to be responsible for the major part of this divergence. We conclude that the two-level filter is necessary to adequately address decoupling and subcanopy advection at our site, and we recommend this filter for all forested EC sites.

AB Decomposition of soil organic matter (SOM) in permafrost terrain and the production of greenhouse gases is a key factor for understanding climate change-carbon feedbacks. Previous studies have shown that SOM decomposition is mostly controlled by soil temperature, soil moisture, and carbon-nitrogen ratio (C:N). However, focus has generally been on site-specific processes and little is known about variations in the controls on SOM decomposition across Arctic sites. For assessing SOM decomposition, we retrieved 241 samples from 101 soil profiles across three contrasting Arctic regions and incubated them in the laboratory under aerobic conditions. We assessed soil carbon losses (C-loss) five times during a 1year incubation. The incubated material consisted of near-surface active layer (AL(NS)), subsurface active layer (AL(SS)), peat, and permafrost samples. Samples were analyzed for carbon, nitrogen, water content, C-13, N-15, and dry bulk density (DBD). While no significant differences were observed between total AL(SS) and permafrost C-loss over 1year incubation (2.32.4% and 2.51.5% C-loss, respectively), AL(NS) samples showed higher C-loss (7.94.2%). DBD was the best explanatory parameter for active layer C-loss across sites. Additionally, results of permafrost samples show that C:N ratio can be used to characterize initial C-loss between sites. This data set on the influence of abiotic parameter on microbial SOM decomposition can improve model simulations of Arctic soil CO2 production by providing representative mean values of CO2 production rates and identifying standard parameters or proxies for upscaling potential CO2 production from site to regional scales.

AB Eastern Estonia has large oil shale mines and industrial facilities mainly focused on electricity generation from oil shale and shale oil extraction, which produce high air pollution emissions. The "Study of the health impact of the oil shale sector-SOHOS" was aimed at identifying the impacts on residents' health and annoyance due to the industrial processing. First, a population-wide survey about health effects and annoyance was carried out. Second, the total and oil shale sectors' emitted concentrations of benzene, phenol, and PM2.5 were modelled. Third, the differences between groups were tested and relationships between health effects and environmental pollution studied using multiple regression analysis. Compared to the control groups from non-industrial areas in Tartu or Laane-Viru, residents of Ida-Viru more frequently (p < 0.05) reported wheezing, chest tightness, shortness of breath, asthma attacks, a long-term cough, hypertension, heart diseases, myocardial infarction, stroke, and diabetes. All health effects except asthma were reported more frequently among non-Estonians. People living in regions with higher levels of PM2.5, had significantly higher odds (p < 0.05) of experiencing chest tightness (OR = 1.13, 95% CI 1.02-1.26), shortness of breath (1.16, 1.03-1.31) or an asthma attack (1.22, 1.04-1.42) during the previous year. People living in regions with higher levels of benzene had higher odds of experiencing myocardial infarction (1.98, 1.11-3.53) and with higher levels of phenol chest tightness (1.44, 1.03-2.00), long-term cough (1.48, 1.06-2.07) and myocardial infarction (2.17, 1.23-3.83). The prevalence of adverse health effects was also higher among those who had been working in the oil shale sector. Next to direct health effects, up to a quarter of the residents of Ida-Viru County were highly annoyed about air pollution. Perceived health risk from air pollution increased the odds of being annoyed. Annoyed people in Ida-Viru had significantly higher odds of experiencing respiratory symptoms during the last 12 months, e.g., wheezing (2.30, 1.31-4.04), chest tightness (2.88, 1.91-4.33 or attack of coughing (1.99, 1.34-2.95).

AB Plant roots control uptake of water and nutrients and cope with environmental challenges. The root epidermis provides the first selective interface for nutrient absorption, while the endodermis produces the main apoplastic diffusion barrier in the form of a structure called the Casparian strip. The positioning of root hairs on epidermal cells, and of the Casparian strip around endodermal cells, requires asymmetries along cellular axes (cell polarity). Cell polarity is termed planar polarity, when coordinated within the plane of a given tissue layer. Here, we review recent molecular advances towards understanding both the polar positioning of the proteo-lipid membrane domain instructing root hair initiation, and the cytoskeletal, trafficking and polar tethering requirements of proteins at outer or inner plasma membrane domains. Finally, we highlight progress towards understanding mechanisms of Casparian strip formation and underlying endodermal cell polarity.

AB Declining atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition in northern Europe and parts of North America, coupled with ongoing changes in climate, has the potential to alter the nutrient limitation status of freshwater ecosystems. In this study we compared time series data of atmospheric N deposition, air temperature, and precipitation with corresponding estimates of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN), total phosphorus (TP), DIN: TP, and total organic carbon from 78 headwater streams and 95 nutrient-poor lakes in Sweden from 1998 to 2013 to assess trends in, and potential drivers of, lake N:P ratios. We found that trends in nutrients were variable at the scale of individual lakes but were highly synchronous at the regional scale, suggesting underlying control by broad-scale environmental drivers mediated by site-specific characteristics. Widespread declines in lake DIN throughout Sweden were correlated with declines in atmospheric N deposition, particularly in northern areas. TP did not have strong directional trends, but interannual variability was synchronous at regional scales, implying that broad-scale climate drivers were affecting these trends. Overall, we observed a significant decline in DIN:TP throughout Sweden over the monitoring period. At the beginning of the study period, 32% of lakes were N limited and 45% colimited by N and P. Proportions increased to 63% of lakes N limited and 20% colimited by N and P at the end of the study period. These results suggest that N limitation is likely to become more widespread in subarctic and boreal areas of Europe in the future if recent trends continue.
   Plain Language Summary This article examines the way in which changes in the amount of nitrogen from the atmosphere being delivered to lakes (as a result of fossil fuel combustion) are interacting with global climate change to affect nutrient availability in Swedish lakes. Nitrogen can act as fertilizer in lakes, supporting increased growth of algae and aquatic plants. The amount of nitrogen relative to other important elements such as phosphorus can help to determine which groups of plants and algae dominate lake ecosystems, as well as how much living biomass lakes can sustain. We find that declines in atmospheric deposition of nitrogen, which have resulted from the adoption of policies controlling emissions from fossil fuel combustion, have caused declines in nitrogen concentrations in lakes throughout Sweden. This has changed the balance of nitrogen and phosphorus, which may result in changes to the structure of lake biological communities. At the same time, variability in climate also has subtle but widespread affects on lake nutrient concentrations, suggesting that the availability of nutrients in lakes at northern latitudes is likely to change in the future as the climate warms.

AB Nitrogen (N) addition effects on boreal forest ecosystem are influenced by an interplay between N-form and N-dose. We hypothesize that trees take up organic N more efficiently than inorganic N and that unwanted side-effects of organic N are smaller. We predicted that 1) the tree growth response to arginine (ARG) addition is larger than to ammonium-nitrate (AN) and, 2) understory vegetation and ectomycorrhizal (EcM) changes following ARG addition are smaller than following AN addition.
   We investigated the effects of AN and ARG addition (50 and 150 kg N ha(-1)) during five years on tree growth, understory vegetation and EcM fungi in a Pinus sylvestris L. forest (c 50 years old) in northern Sweden.
   N addition increased tree growth and changed understory vegetation composition with few significant differences between AN and ARG. Differences in responses mainly occurred for the bryophyte Pleurozium schreberi which decreased more from ARG, and for EcM sporocarps, which sharply declined from AN, but not from ARG.
   We found very few differences in responses between AN and ARG addition with the exception of EcM and bryophytes. These species groups have several key functions in boreal forests and the differences in responses merits further investigations.

AB Understanding how loss of biodiversity affects ecosystem functioning, and thus the delivery of ecosystem goods and services, has become increasingly necessary in a changing world. Considerable recent attention has focused on predicting how biodiversity loss simultaneously impacts multiple ecosystem functions (that is, ecosystem multifunctionality), but the ways in which these effects vary across ecosystems remain unclear. Here, we report the results of two 19-year plant diversity manipulation experiments, each established across a strong environmental gradient. Although the effects of plant and associated fungal diversity loss on individual functions frequently differed among ecosystems, the consequences of biodiversity loss for multifunctionality were relatively invariant. However, the context-dependency of biodiversity effects also worked in opposing directions for different individual functions, meaning that similar multifunctionality values across contrasting ecosystems could potentially mask important differences in the effects of biodiversity on functioning among ecosystems. Our findings highlight that an understanding of the relative contribution of species or functional groups to individual ecosystem functions among contrasting ecosystems and their interactions (that is, complementarity versus competition) is critical for guiding management efforts aimed at maintaining ecosystem multifunctionality and the delivery of multiple ecosystem services.

AB Anthropogenic fires and land-use change, including the conversion from native to exotic species canopies, are two major types of disturbances that strongly affect the functioning of forest ecosystems around the world. These disturbances alter the resource availability for plants, which may lead to changes in species richness. Here we examined the relative effects of canopy cover type, light availability and soil nutrient (N and P) availability on species richness, including invasive species, at different post-fire plant systems. Additionally, we tested the resource heterogeneity hypothesis (RHH) for plant diversity, which proposes that diversity is higher in habitats with spatially heterogeneous resources. We evaluated four different canopy cover types, including mature and second-growth Nothofagus pumilio forests, treeless prairie, Pinus sylvestris afforestations, all of which were converted from mature N. pumilio forests. Using generalized mixed-effects model correlations, we determined (1) the relative influence of canopy cover type, light and soil nutrient availability on understory species richness and (2) the relationship between species richness and resource heterogeneity. We found that canopy cover type was the factor that best explained species richness, much more than fine-scale light and soil nutrient availability. Additionally, we found that the more homogeneous the light environment the higher the number of exotic species (mainly found in the prairie where the highest light intensity occurred), which is contrary to what the RHH states. In conclusion, canopy cover type, a stand-scale driver, and not fine-scale resource (light, N and P) availability, was most important for explaining native and exotic (including invasive) species understory richness in a landscape affected by anthropogenic fires and posterior land-use change.

AB ObjectivesTo assess the use of post radical prostatectomy (RP) urinary incontinence (PPI) surgery and to investigate factors related to its use.
   MethodsCohort study in Prostate Cancer database Sweden (PCBaSe) of men who underwent primary RP between 1998 and 2012. PPI correction procedures were identified in the Patient Registry. Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of PPI surgeries were estimated.
   ResultsSeven hundred eighty-two out of 26280 (3%) men underwent PPI surgery at a median time of 3 years after RP. There was an eightfold increase in the absolute number of PPI surgeries during 2000-2014 and a threefold increase in the number per 1000 RPs performed. Factors associated with high use PPI surgery were age >70, HR 1.96 (1.54-2.50), and high hospital RP volume (>100 RPs/year), HR 0.81 (0.66-0.99). There was a 10-fold difference in use of PPI surgery per 1000 RPs between the county with the highest versus lowest use. In a subgroup of men with Patient-Reported Outcome Measures (PROM); severe PPI was reported by 7% of men and 24% of them underwent PPI surgery.
   ConclusionsThree percent of all men received PPI surgery, with a 10-fold variation among health care providers. Only a quarter of men with severe PPI underwent PPI surgery, suggesting that PPI surgery remains underutilized.

AB We report on the self-assembly of semicrystalline [6,6]-phenyl-C-61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) nanosheets at the interface between a hydrophobic solvent and water, and utilize this opportunity for the realization of electronically active organic/organic molecular heterostructures. The self-assembled PCBM nanosheets can feature a lateral size of >1 cm(2) and be transferred from the water surface to both hydrophobic and hydrophilic surfaces using facile transfer techniques. We employ a transferred single PCBM nanosheet as the active material in a field-effect transistor (FET) and verify semiconductor function by a measured electron mobility of 1.2 X 10(-2) cm(2) V-1 s(-1) and an on off ratio of similar to 1 x 10(4). We further fabricate a planar organic/organic heterostructure with the p-type organic semiconductor poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,S-diyl) as the bottom layer and the n-type PCBM nanosheet as the top layer and demonstrate ambipolar FET operation with an electron mobility of 8.7 X 10(-4) cm(2) V-1 s(-1) and a hole mobility of 3.1 X 10(-4) cm(2) V-1 s(-1).

AB Comprehension of underlying mechanisms of probiotic action will support rationale selection of probiotic strains and targeted clinical study design with a higher likelihood of success. This will consequently contribute to better substantiation of health claims. Here, we aim to provide a perspective from a microbiology point of view that such comprehensive understanding is not straightforward. We show examples of well-documented probiotic effector molecules in Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium strains, including surface-located molecules such as specific pili, S-layer proteins, exopolysaccharides, muropeptides, as well as more widely produced metabolites such as tryptophan-related and histamine-related metabolites, CpG-rich DNA, and various enzymes such as lactase and bile salt hydrolases. We also present recent advances in genetic tool development, microbiome analyses and model systems, as well as perspectives on how the field could further progress. This opinion is based on a discussion group organized at the annual meeting of the International Scientific Association on Probiotics and Prebiotics (ISAPP) in June 2017.

AB The Fourth Collaborative Material Exercise (CMX-4) of the Nuclear Forensics International Technical Working Group (ITWG) registered the largest participation for this exercise in nuclear forensics, with seven of the 17 laboratories participating for the first time. Each of the laboratories had their strategic role to play in its respective country, analyzing real-world samples using their in-house resources. The scenario was fictitious but was thoughtfully crafted to engage participants in nuclear forensic investigations. In this paper, participants from five of the first-time laboratories shared their individual experience in this exercise, from preparation to analysis of samples.

AB An international group of laboratories participating in CMX-4 subjected three samples to comparative nuclear forensic analysis using uranium assay and trace element analysis techniques to determine if the samples had similar or different origins. Uranium assay indicated that two pellet samples (ES-2 and ES-3) were nearly pure UO2 while the black powder sample ES-1 was primarily UO2 with UO3 and/or U3O8 forms present as impurities. Trace element analysis by five of the six participating laboratories reported molybdenum concentrations below 10 A mu g/g U in all of the exercise samples, suggesting the same likely facility of origin for all three samples.

AB This work presents the results for identification of chemical phases obtained by several laboratories as a part of an international nuclear forensic round-robin exercise. In this work powder X-ray diffraction (p-XRD) is regarded as the reference technique. Neutron diffraction produced a superior high-angle diffraction pattern relative to p-XRD. Requiring only small amounts of sample, A mu-Raman spectroscopy was used for the first time in this context as a potentially complementary technique to p-XRD. The chemical phases were identified as pure UO2 in two materials, and as a mixture of UO2, U3O8 and an intermediate species U3O7 in the third material.

AB In a recent international exercise, 10 international nuclear forensics laboratories successfully performed radiochronometry on three low enriched uranium oxide samples, providing 12 analytical results using three different parent-daughter pairs serving as independent chronometers. The vast majority of the results were consistent with one another and consistent with the known processing history of the materials. In general, for these particular samples, mass spectrometry gave more accurate and more precise analytical results than decay counting measurements. In addition, the concordance of the U-235-Pa-231 and U-234-Th-230 chronometers confirmed the validity of the age dating assumptions, increasing confidence in the resulting conclusions.

AB IntroductionEvidence has shown that the experience of violence by a partner has important influences on women's risk of HIV acquisition. Using a randomized experiment in northeast South Africa, we found that a conditional cash transfer (CCT) targeted to poor girls in high school reduced the risk of physical intimate partner violence (IPV) in the past 12months by 34%. The purpose of this analysis is to understand the pathways through which the CCT affects IPV.
   MethodsHPTN 068 was a phase 3, randomized controlled trial in rural Mpumalanga province, South Africa. Eligible young women (aged 13-20) and their parents or guardians were randomly assigned (1:1) to either receive a monthly cash transfer conditional on monthly high school attendance or no cash transfer. Between 2011 and 2015, participants (N=2,448) were interviewed at baseline, then at annual follow-up visits at 12, 24 and 36months. The total effect of the CCT on IPV was estimated using a GEE log-binomial regression model. We then estimated controlled direct effects to examine mediation of direct effects through intermediate pathways. Mediators include sexual partnership measures, the sexual relationship power scale, and household consumption measures.
   ResultsWe found evidence that the CCT works in part through delaying sexual debut or reducing the number of sexual partners. The intervention interacts with these mediators leading to larger reductions in IPV risk compared to the total effect of the CCT on any physical IPV [RR 0.66, CI(95%):0.59-0.74]. The largest reductions are seen when we estimate the controlled direct effect under no sexual debut [RR 0.57, CI(95%):0.48-0.65] or under no sexual partner in the last 12months [RR 0.53, CI(95%):0.46-0.60].
   ConclusionsResults indicate that a CCT for high school girls has protective effects on their experience of IPV and that the effect is due in part to girls choosing not to engage in sexual partnerships, thereby reducing the opportunity for IPV. As a lower exposure to IPV and safer sexual behaviours also protect against HIV acquisition, this study adds to the growing body of evidence on how cash transfers may reduce young women's HIV risk.

AB Background: Old age at prostate cancer diagnosis has been associated with poor prognosis in several studies. We aimed to investigate the association between age at diagnosis and prognosis, and if it is independent of tumor characteristics, primary treatment, year of diagnosis, mode of detection and comorbidity.
   Patients and methods: We conducted a nation-wide cohort study including 121 392 Swedish men aged 55-95 years in Prostate Cancer data Base Sweden 3.0 diagnosed with prostate cancer in 1998-2012 and followed for prostate cancer death through 2014. Data were available on age, stage, grade, prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-level, mode of detection, comorbidity, educational level and primary treatment. We used Cox regression to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).
   Results: With increasing age at diagnosis, men had more comorbidity, fewer PSA-detected cancers, more advanced cancers and were less often treated with curative intent. Among men with high-risk or regionally metastatic disease, the proportion of men with unknown M stage was higher among old men versus young men. During a follow-up of 751 000 person-years, 23 649 men died of prostate cancer. In multivariable Cox-regression analyses stratified by treatment, old age at diagnosis was associated with poorer prognosis among men treated with deferred treatment (HRage 85+ versus 60-64: 7.19; 95% CI: 5.61-9.20), androgen deprivation therapy (HRage 85+ versus 60-64: 1.72; 95% CI: 1.61-1.84) or radical prostatectomy (HRage 75+ versus 60-64: 2.20; 95% CI: 1.01-4.77), but not radiotherapy (HRage 75thorn versus 60-64: 1.08; 95% CI: 0.76-1.53).
   Conclusion: Our findings argue against a strong inherent effect of age on risk of prostate cancer death, but indicate that in current clinical practice, old men with prostate cancer receive insufficient diagnostic workup and subsequent curative treatment.

AB Background: Smoking has been associated with colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence and mortality in previous studies and might also be associated with prognosis after CRC diagnosis. However, current evidence on smoking in association with CRC prognosis is limited.
   Patients and methods: For this individual patient data meta-analysis, sociodemographic and smoking behavior information of 12 414 incident CRC patients (median age at diagnosis: 64.3 years), recruited within 14 prospective cohort studies among previously cancer-free adults, was collected at baseline and harmonized across studies. Vital status and causes of death were collected for a mean follow-up time of 5.1 years following cancer diagnosis. Associations of smoking behavior with overall and CRC-specific survival were evaluated using Cox regression and standard meta-analysis methodology.
   Results: A total of 5229 participants died, 3194 from CRC. Cox regression revealed significant associations between former [hazard ratio (HR) = 1.12; 95 % confidence interval (CI) = 1.04-1.20] and current smoking (HR = 1.29; 95% CI = 1.04-1.60) and poorer overall survival compared with never smoking. Compared with current smoking, smoking cessation was associated with improved overall (HR<10years = 0.78; 95% CI = 0.69-0.88; HR >= 10years = 0.78; 95% CI = 0.63-0.97) and CRC-specific survival (HR similar to 10 years = 0.76; 95% CI = 0.67-0.85).
   Conclusion: In this large meta-analysis including primary data of incident CRC patients from 14 prospective cohort studies on the association between smoking and CRC prognosis, former and current smoking were associated with poorer CRC prognosis compared with never smoking. Smoking cessation was associated with improved survival when compared with current smokers. Future studies should further quantify the benefits of nonsmoking, both for cancer prevention and for improving survival among CRC patients, in particular also in terms of treatment response.

AB Cognitive control is the foundation for attaining goals by flexible adaptation of action to changing environmental demands. It has been hypothesized to be critically dependent upon the prefrontal cortex (PFC). In this mini-review, evidence for domain-general versus domain-specific cognitive control is examined, with a particular focus on attention and memory. The reviewed studies examined different levels of cognitive control in relation to performance and patterns of brain activity, and a few included direct comparisons of cognitive-control modulations across cognitive domains. Within domains, increased demands on cognitive control consistently translated into increased PFC activity, but limited overlap in recruited PFC regions was observed between domains. It is concluded that the PFC supports multiple cognitive-control systems that collectively may be conceived of as a distributed executive.

AB Silicate sorption on ferrihydrite surfaces, as monomers, oligomers, and polymers, strongly affects ferrihydrite crystallinity, thermodynamic stability, and surface reactivity. How these silicate species bind on ferrihydrite surfaces is, however, not well understood. We have determined silicate binding geometries using a combination of X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), differential atomic pair distribution function (d-PDF) analysis, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Silicon K-edge absorption pre edges and DFT-predicted energies indicate that silicate forms monomeric monodentate mononuclear (MM) complexes at low silicate sorption loadings. With increasing silicate loading, the pre-edge peak shifts to higher energies, suggesting changes in the silicate binding geometry toward multidentate complexation. The d-PDF analysis determines the Si Fe interatomic distance to be 3.25 A for the high-loading samples. The DFT calculations indicate that such distance corresponds to an oligomer in the bidentate binuclear (BB) binding geometry. The transition of the silicate sorption geometry accompanied by polymerization can affect stability of ferrihydrite and its adsorption and redox reactivity and increase the degree of Si isotopic fractionation upon silicate sorption on Fe oxides. MM monomeric complexes and BB oligomeric complexes should be used for surface complexation models predicting silicate sorption on Fe oxide surfaces.

AB Although theoretical studies have shown that the mixture strategy, which uses multiple toxins simultaneously, can effectively delay the evolution of insecticide resistance, whether it is the optimal management strategy under different insect life histories and insecticide types remains unknown. To test the robustness of this management strategy over different life histories, we developed a series of simulation models that cover almost all the diploid insect types and have the same basic structure describing pest population dynamics and resistance evolution with discrete time steps. For each of two insecticidal toxins, independent one-locus two-allele autosomal inheritance of resistance was assumed. The simulations demonstrated the optimality of the mixture strategy either when insecticide efficacy was incomplete or when some part of the population disperses between patches before mating. The rotation strategy, which uses one insecticide on one pest generation and a different one on the next, did not differ from sequential usage in the time to resistance, except when dominance was low. It was the optimal strategy when insecticide efficacy was high and premating selection and dispersal occur.

AB The susceptibility of untreated and sulfuric-acid-pretreated aspen, birch, and spruce to analytical enzymatic saccharification was studied in relation to their chemical composition and physical-structural features. The analytical data collected covered the mass fractions of lignin, carbohydrates, and extractives, the release of acetic acid, formic acid, and uronic acids by acid and alkaline hydrolysis, crystallinity and crystallite size, syringyl: guaiacyl (S:G) ratio of lignin, cellulose accessibility, FTIR spectra, images from SEM and fluorescence microscopy, and susceptibility to enzymatic saccharification using enzyme mixtures with and without supplementary xylanase. In the absence of pretreatment the mass fraction yield of Glc on the original dry wood in the analytical enzymatic saccharification increased in the order birch (16 g kg(-1)) < spruce (35 g kg(-1)) < aspen (150 g kg(-1)). After acid pretreatment, the order changed to spruce (170 g kg(-1)) < aspen (290 g kg(-1)), birch (290 g kg(-1)). The relatively high recalcitrance of untreated birch was not possible to relate to mass fraction of lignin, S: G ratio, cellulose crystallinity, or mass fraction of acetyl, but rather to structural features, such as a more compact surface structure with high density and low cellulose accessibility. The relatively high sugar yields from both untreated and pretreated aspen suggest that aspen wood is well suited as feedstock for production of liquid biofuels and green chemicals in forest-based biorefineries.

AB Several studies have been carried out to investigate soil compaction and rutting after logging vehicle traffic, based on time consuming and punctual field measurements. The objective of this study was to measure soil disturbances with two methods: (i) a new, image-based models derived by a structure-from-motion (SfM) photogrammetry approach; and (ii) a traditional soil sampling (bulk density and shear strength). Two trails were selected in a logging area (central Italy), one trafficked by a forwarder (FT) and one trafficked by a skidder (ST). Data collection was conducted before, during and after timber extraction. Image-based models derived by SfM photogrammetry was used to highlight the differences in the shape and distribution of the disturbances along ST and FT. Results showed that the physical parameters of soil significantly changed due to both FT and ST traffic. Machine passes increased bulk density (111% and 31% for FT and ST, respectively), penetration resistance (29% and 24% for FT and ST, respectively) and shear resistance (14% and 6% for FT and ST, respectively), whereas porosity decreased (46% and 9% for FT and ST, respectively). Significant differences between FT and ST were found when comparing ruts removal and bulges with SfM photogrammetry. After logging, FT clearly showed ruts and bulges, whereas in ST ruts and bulges were not visible, but soil displacement in the direction of extraction was evident and measurable. Nevertheless, although our result shows a larger soil disturbance caused by forwarders than skidders, it is not possible to draw any general conclusions about differences between the two machines. Data about the machine passes, or the wood volumes transported over each trial area were not available; therefore, any general conclusion is misleading. SfM photogrammetry give information not available via traditional methods, thus improving impact assessment.

AB BackgroundEarly detection of autoimmune Addison's disease (AAD) is important as delay in diagnosis may result in a life-threatening adrenal crisis and death. The classical clinical picture of untreated AAD is well-described, but methodical investigations are scarce.
   ObjectivePerform a retrospective audit of patient records with the aim of identifying biochemical markers for early diagnosis of AAD.
   Material and MethodsA multicentre retrospective study including 272 patients diagnosed with AAD at hospitals in Norway and Sweden during 1978-2016. Scrutiny of medical records provided patient data and laboratory values.
   ResultsLow sodium occurred in 207 of 247 (84%), but only one-third had elevated potassium. Other common nonendocrine tests were largely normal. TSH was elevated in 79 of 153 patients, and hypoglycaemia was found in 10%. Thirty-three per cent were diagnosed subsequent to adrenal crisis, in whom electrolyte disturbances were significantly more pronounced (P < 0.001). Serum cortisol was consistently decreased (median 62 nmol L-1 [1-668]) and significantly lower in individuals with adrenal crisis (38 nmol L-1 [2-442]) than in those without (81 nmol L-1 [1-668], P < 0.001).
   ConclusionThe most consistent biochemical finding of untreated AAD was low sodium independent of the degree of glucocorticoid deficiency. Half of the patients had elevated TSH levels. Only a minority presented with marked hyperkalaemia or other nonhormonal abnormalities. Thus, unexplained low sodium and/or elevated TSH should prompt consideration of an undiagnosed AAD, and on clinical suspicion bring about assay of cortisol and ACTH. Presence of 21-hydroxylase autoantibodies confirms autoimmune aetiology. Anticipating additional abnormalities in routine blood tests may delay diagnosis.

AB BackgroundCoffee drinking has been implicated in mortality and a variety of diseases but potential mechanisms underlying these associations are unclear. Large-scale systems epidemiological approaches may offer novel insights to mechanisms underlying associations of coffee with health.
   ObjectiveWe performed an analysis of known and novel protein markers linked to cardiovascular disease and their association with habitual coffee intake in the Prospective Study of the Vasculature in Uppsala Seniors (PIVUS, n = 816) and followed up top proteins in the Uppsala Longitudinal Study of Adult Men (ULSAM, n = 635) and EpiHealth (n = 2418).
   MethodsIn PIVUS and ULSAM, coffee intake was measured by 7-day dietary records whilst a computer-based food frequency questionnaire was used in EpiHealth. Levels of up to 80 proteins were assessed in plasma by a proximity extension assay.
   ResultsFour protein-coffee associations adjusted for age, sex, smoking and BMI, met statistical significance in PIVUS (FDR < 5%, P < 2.31 x 10(-3)): leptin (LEP), chitinase-3-like protein 1 (CHI3L), tumour necrosis factor (TNF) receptor 6 and TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand. The inverse association between coffee intake and LEP replicated in ULSAM (, -0.042 SD per cup of coffee, P = 0.028) and EpiHealth (, -0.025 SD per time of coffee, P = 0.004). The negative coffee-CHI3L association replicated in EpiHealth (, -0.07, P = 1.15 x 10(-7)), but not in ULSAM (, -0.034, P = 0.16).
   ConclusionsThe current study supports an inverse association between coffee intake and plasma LEP and CHI3L1 levels. The coffee-CHI3L1 association is novel and warrants further investigation given links between CHI3L1 and health conditions that are also potentially influenced by coffee.

AB Equilibria between Al3+ and the polyelectrolyte polyacrylic acid (PAA) were studied in 0.1 M NaCl medium at 25 A degrees C (M = mol dm(-3)). The measurements were performed as precise potentiometric titrations in which OH- was in most cases generated coulometrically. The total concentration of Al(III) and PAA varied within the limits 6.23 x 10(-5)-2.01 x 10(-4) M and 7.20 x 10(-4)-1.12 x 10(-3) M, resp., with a 4-18 fold excess of ligand. The value of - log{[H+]/mol dm(-3)} varied between 3 and 5-7, the upper limit set by drifting EMF potentials caused by the onset of a precipitation reaction. The constant capacitance model was utilized to model the experimental data. With the objective of finding a model as simple as possible that gives an acceptable fit to data, the two species AlPAA(2+) and Al(OH)(2)PAA are postulated. The polyelectrolyte effect resulting in pH-dependent formation constants is demonstrated. Furthermore a comparison between the stability constant of the 1:1 complexes of Al3+ with acrylate(-) and PAA(-), respectively, shows the logK value of the latter to be five units higher and is ascribed to particular properties of the polyelectrolyte.

AB Low platelet monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) activity, proxy of low central serotonergic functions, has been shown to correlate with criminal behavior in adolescents that come from an unfavorable psychosocial environment but not in adolescents from good conditions, indicating a link between environment, MAO-B activity and aggressive behavior. The purpose of this study was to examine the association between MAO-B activity and lifetime interpersonal violence in suicide attempters. The study included a total of 28 suicide attempters (18 men and 10 women). Assessments of childhood exposure to and expressed interpersonal violence during childhood and as an adult were carried out with the Karolinska Interpersonal Violence Scale (KIVS). Platelet MAO-B activity was measured with 2-phenylethylamine (b-PEA) as substrate. Broken down by gender, the correlations between platelet MAO-B activity and both exposure scores to interpersonal violence as a child and expressed lifetime interpersonal violence were significant in male suicide attempters (r = -0.61, p = 0.035; r = - 0.84, p = 0.0005), but not in women. Our finding of significant associations between interpersonal violence and low MAO-B activity need to be replicated in other cohorts of suicide attempters.

AB Aims: It is important to predict response to treatment with temozolomide (TMZ) in glioblastoma (GBM) patients. Both MGMT protein expression and MGMT promoter methylation status have been reported to predict the response to TMZ. We investigated the prognostic value of quantified MGMT protein levels in tumour cells and the prognostic importance of combining information of MGMT protein level and MGMT promoter methylation status. Methods: MGMT protein expression was quantified in tumour cells in 171 GBMs from the population-based Region of Southern Denmark (RSD)cohort using a double immunofluorescence approach. Pyrosequencing was performed in 157 patients. For validation we used GBM-patients from a Nordic Study (NS) investigating the effect of radiotherapy and different TMZ schedules. Results: When divided at the median, patients with low expression of MGMT protein (AF-low) had the best prognosis (HR = 1.5, P = 0.01). Similar results were observed in the subgroup of patients receiving the Stupp regimen (HR = 2.0, P = 0.001). In the NS-cohort a trend towards superior survival (HR = 1.6, P = 0.08) was seen in patients with AF-low. Including MGMT promoter methylation status, we found for both cohorts that patients with methylated MGMT promoter and AF-low had the best outcome; median OS 23.1 and 20.0 months, respectively. Conclusion: Our data indicate that MGMT protein expression in tumour cells has an independent prognostic significance. Exclusion of nontumour cells contributed to a more exact analysis of tumour-specific MGMT protein expression. This should be incorporated in future studies evaluating MGMT status before potential integration into clinical practice.

AB The influence of reactor type and operating conditions of the pyrolysis unit on the final concentration of toxic contaminants in biochar remains unclear. Therefore, we determined the concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), oxygenated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (oxy-PAHs), nitrogen-containing polycyclic aromatic compounds (N-PACs), polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), and dibenzofurans (PCDFs) in biochars produced from three different feedstocks (softwood, wheat straw, and anaerobic digestate). Different scaled pyrolysis units (one batch and two continuous units) at two different temperatures (550 and 700 degrees C) were considered. The results revealed that the type of biomass had a significant influence on the PAH, oxy-PAH, and N-PAC content of the biochars. The configuration and type of the pyrolysis unit influenced only the wheat straw pyrolyzed at 550 degrees C. PCDDs and PCDFs occurred at very low levels in the biochars. In terms of PAH, PCDD, and PCDF content, the biochars assessed in this study represent a low risk to the environment, regardless of the temperature and type and size of the pyrolysis unit.

AB High-latitude boreal and arctic surface/inland waters contain sizeable reservoirs of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and trace elements (TE), which are subject to seasonal freezing. Specifically, shallow ponds and lakes in the permafrost zone often freeze solid, which can lead to transformations in the colloidal and dissolved fractions of DOM and TE. Here, we present results from experimental freeze-thaw cycles using iron (Fe)- and DOM-rich water from thaw ponds situated in Stordalen and Storflaket palsa mires in northern Sweden. After ten cycles of freezing, 85% of Fe and 25% of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) were removed from solution in circumneutral fen water (pH 6.9) but a much smaller removal of Fe and DOC (< 7%) was found in acidic bog water (pH 3.6). This removal pattern was consistent with initial supersaturation of fen water with respect to Fe hydroxide and a lack of supersaturation with any secondary mineral phase in the bog water. There was a nearly two- to threefold increase in the low-molecular-weight (LMW) fraction of organic carbon (OC) and several TEs caused by the repeated freeze-thaw cycles. Future increases in the freeze-thaw frequency of surface waters with climate warming may remove up to 25% of DOC in circumneutral organic-rich waters. Furthermore, an increase of LMW OC may result in enhanced carbon dioxide losses from aquatic ecosystems since this fraction is potentially more susceptible to biodegradation.

AB Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) afflicts 3%-5% of women of childbearing age, and is characterised by recurrent negative mood symptoms (eg, irritability, depression, anxiety and emotional lability) during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. The aetiology of PMDD is unknown, although a temporal association with circulating ovarian steroids, in particular progesterone and its metabolite allopregnanolone, has been established during the luteal phase. Allopregnanolone is a positive modulator of the GABA(A) receptor: it is sedative in high concentrations but may precipitate paradoxical adverse effects on mood at levels corresponding to luteal phase concentrations in susceptible women. Saccadic eye velocity (SEV) is a measure of GABA(A) receptor sensitivity; in experimental studies of healthy women, i.v. allopregnanolone decreases SEV. Women with PMDD display an altered sensitivity to an i.v. injection of allopregnanolone compared to healthy controls in this model. In functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies, women with PMDD react differently to emotional stimuli in contrast to controls. A consistent finding in PMDD patients is increased amygdala reactivity during the luteal phase. Post-mortem studies in humans have revealed that allopregnanolone concentrations vary across different brain regions, although mean levels in the brain also reflect variations in peripheral serum concentrations. The amygdala processes emotions such as anxiety and aggression. This is interesting because allopregnanolone is detected at high concentrations within the region into which marked increases in blood flow are measured with fMRI following progesterone/allopregnanolone administration. Allopregnanolone effects are antagonised by its isomer isoallopregnanolone (UC1010), which significantly reduces negative mood symptoms in women with PMDD when administered s.c. in the premenstrual phase. This was shown in a randomised, placebo-controlled clinical trial in which the primary outcome was change in symptom scoring on the Daily Rating of Severity of Problems (DRSP): the treatment reduced negative mood scores (P<.005), as well as total DRSP scores (P<.01), compared to placebo in women with PMDD. In conclusion, the underlying studies of this review provide evidence that allopregnanolone is the provoking factor behind the negative mood symptoms in PMDD and that isoallopregnanolone could ameliorate the symptoms as a result of its ability to antagonise the allopregnanolone effect on the GABA(A) receptor.

AB Non-additive genetic effects can be effectively exploited in control-pollinated families with the availability of genome-wide markers. We used 41,304 SNP markers and compared pedigree vs. marker-based genetic models by analysing height, diameter, basic density and pulp yield for Eucalyptus urophylla x E.grandis control-pollinated families represented by 949 informative individuals. We evaluated models accounting for additive, dominance, and first-order epistatic interactions (additive by additive, dominance by dominance, and additive by dominance). We showed that the models can capture a large proportion of the genetic variance from dominance and epistasis for growth traits as those components are typically not independent. We also showed that we could partition genetic variances more precisely when using relationship matrices derived from markers compared to using only pedigree information. In addition, phenotypic prediction accuracies were only slightly increased by including dominance effects for growth traits since estimates of non-additive variances yielded rather high standard errors. This novel result improves our current understanding of the architecture of quantitative traits and recommends accounting for dominance variance when developing genomic selection strategies in hybrid Eucalyptus.

AB Tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy (TDLAS) is employed for simultaneous detection of gas temperature, water vapor (H2O) and gas-phase atomic potassium, K(g), in an atmospheric, research-scale entrained flow reactor (EFR). In situ measurements are conducted at four different locations in the EFR core to study the progress of thermochemical conversion of softwood and Miscanthus powders with focus on the primary potassium reactions. In an initial validation step during propane flame operation, the measured axial EFR profiles of H2O density-weighted, path-averaged temperature, path-averaged H2O concentration and H2O column density are found in good agreement with 2D CFD simulations and standard flue gas analysis. During biomass conversion, temperature and H2O are significantly higher than for the propane flame, up to 1500K and 9%, respectively, and K(g) concentrations between 0.2 and 270 ppbv are observed. Despite the large difference in initial potassium content between the fuels, the K(g) concentrations obtained at each EFR location are comparable, which highlights the importance of considering all major ash-forming elements in the fuel matrix. For both fuels, temperature and K(g) decrease with residence time, and in the lower part of the EFR, K(g) is in excellent agreement with thermodynamic equilibrium calculations evaluated at the TDLAS-measured temperatures and H2O concentrations. However, in the upper part of the EFR, where the measured H2O suggested a global equivalence ratio smaller than unity, K(g) is far below the predicted equilibrium values. This indicates that, in contrast to the organic compounds, potassium species rapidly undergo primary ash transformation reactions even if the fuel particles reside in an oxygen-deficient environment.

AB Sexual segregation, the tendency to seasonally live in groups comprised of separate sexes, is widespread in sexually dimorphic polygynous ungulates. The causes for such segregation are still being studied and debated to arrive at a universal explanation. We assessed sexual segregation in the markhor, Capra falconeri-a dimorphic mountain ungulate inhabiting a seasonal temperate environment. We observed markhor herd composition, gender-specific diet, and habitat use over 3 years and multiple seasons. We tested the predictions of the Reproductive Strategy-Predation Risk Hypothesis (RSH) that focuses on offspring security, and the Forage Selection-Sexual Dimorphism Hypothesis (FSH) based on different foraging needs between the sexes due to size dimorphism. Generalized linear models were used to identify the important variables that best explained segregation in markhor. Male and female markhor showed a tendency to segregate throughout the year outside the mating season. Female markhor were confined to cliffs with relatively less forage cover, whereas males used areas with relatively better forage away from the security of cliffs. Females also occurred at lower elevations compared to males. Social segregation prevailed during pre-parturition and continued until autumn when the offspring were older, indicating a role of other factors besides predation risk. Sexual segregation in markhor was influenced by multiple mechanisms.

AB In this study a natural mix of microalgae grown in wastewater of municipal character was co-digested with sewage sludge in mesophilic conditions, in both batch and semi-continuous modes. The semi-continuous experiment was divided into two periods with OLR1 (organic loading rate) of 2.4 kg volatile solids (VS) m(-3) d(-1) and HRT1 (hydraulic retention time) of 15 days, and OLR2 of 3.5 kg VS m(-3) d(-1) and HRT2 of 10 days, respectively. Results showed stable conditions during both periods. The methane yield was reduced when adding microalgae (from 200 +/- 25 NmL CH4 g VSin-1, to 168 +/- 22 NmL CH4 g VSin-1) but VS reduction was also decreased by 51%. This low digestibility was confirmed in the anaerobic batch test. However, adding microalgae improved the dewaterability of the digested sludge. The high heavy metals content in the microalgae resulted in a high heavy metals content in the digestate, making it more difficult to reuse the digestate as fertilizer on arable land. The heavy metals are thought to originate from the flue gas used as a CO2 source during the microalgae cultivation. Therefore the implementation of CO2 mitigation via algal cultivation requires careful consideration regarding the source of the CO2-rich gas.

AB Many streams and rivers experience major floods. Historically, human societies have responded to such floods by moving away from them or by abating them, the latter with large negative impacts on stream and river ecology. Societies are currently implementing a strategy of "living with floods,"which may involve ecological restoration. It further involves flood mapping, forecasting, and warning systems. We evaluate 14 different stream-and river-restoration measures, which differ in their capacity to modify water retention and runoff. We discuss these restoration measures in the light of predicted changes in climate and flooding and discuss future restoration needs. We focus on the Nordic countries, where substantial changes in the water cycle are foreseen. We conclude that sustainable solutions require researchers to monitor the effect of flood management and study the relative importance of individual restoration measures, as well as the side effects of flood attenuation.

AB 1. Tropical forest biomass is a crucial component of global carbon emission estimations. However, calibration and validation of such estimates require accurate and effective methods to estimate in situ above-ground biomass (AGB). Present methods rely on allometric models that are highly uncertain for large tropical trees. Terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) tree modelling has demonstrated to be more accurate than these models to infer forest AGB. Nevertheless, applying TLS methods on tropical large trees is still challenging. We propose a method to estimate AGB of large tropical trees by three-dimensional (3D) tree modelling of TLS point clouds.
   2. Twenty-nine plots were scanned with a TLS in three study sites (Peru, Indonesia and Guyana). We identified the largest tree per plot (mean diameter at breast height of 73.5cm), extracted its point cloud and calculated its volume by 3D modelling its structure using quantitative structure models (QSM) and converted to AGB using species-specific wood density. We also estimated AGB using pantropical and local allometric models. To assess the accuracy of our and allometric methods, we harvest the trees and took destructive measurements.
   3. AGB estimates by the TLS-QSM method showed the best agreement in comparison to destructive harvest measurements (28.37% coefficient of variation of root mean square error [CV-RMSE] and concordance correlation coefficient [CCC] of 0.95), outperforming the pantropical allometric models tested (35.6%-54.95% CV-RMSE and CCC of 0.89-0.73). TLS-QSM showed also the lowest bias (overall underestimation of 3.7%) and stability across tree size range, contrasting with the allometric models that showed a systematic bias (overall underestimation ranging 15.2%-35.7%) increasing linearly with tree size. The TLS-QSM method also provided accurate tree wood volume estimates (CV RMSE of 23.7%) with no systematic bias regardless the tree structural characteristics.
   4. Our TLS-QSM method accounts for individual tree biophysical structure more effectively than allometric models, providing more accurate and less biased AGB estimates for large tropical trees, independently of their morphology. This non-destructive method can be further used for testing and calibrating new allometric models, reducing the current under-representation of large trees in and enhancing present and past estimates of forest biomass and carbon emissions from tropical forests.

AB This paper compares optimal nonlinear income tax policies of welfarist and paternalist governments, where the latter does not respect individual preferences regarding relative consumption. Consistent with previous findings, relative consumption concerns typically induce a welfarist government to increase the marginal tax rates to internalize positional externalities. Remarkably, the optimal marginal tax rules are often very similar in the paternalist case, where such externalities are not taken into account. We identify several cases where the marginal tax rules are indeed identical between the governments. Numerical simulations show that marginal and average tax levels and the overall redistribution are often also similar.

AB Background Coeliac disease might affect school performance due to its effect on cognitive performance and related health consequences that might increase school absenteeism. The aim of this study was to investigate whether children with coeliac disease performed differently on completion of ninth grade in school compared with children without coeliac disease.
   Methods Analysis was performed on a population of 445 669 children born in Sweden between 1991 and 1994 of whom 1767 were diagnosed with coeliac disease. School performance at ninth grade was the outcome and coeliac disease was the exposure. Other covariates included sex, Apgar score at 5 min, small for gestational age, year of birth, family type, parental education and income.
   Results There was no association between coeliac disease and school performance at ninth grade (adjusted coefficient -2.4, 95% CI 5.1 to 0.4). A weak association was established between late coeliac diagnosis and higher grades, but this disappeared after adjusting for parent socioeconomic conditions. Being small for gestational age affected performance negatively (adjusted coefficient -6.9, 95% CI 8.0 to 5.7). Grade scores were significantly lower in children living with a single parent (adjusted coefficient -20.6, 95% CI 20.9 to 20.2), compared with those with married/cohabiting parents. A positive association was found between scores at ninth grade and parental education and income.
   Conclusion Coeliac disease diagnosis during childhood is not associated with poor school performance at ninth grade.

AB Aims The hypothesis of 'metabolically healthy obesity' implies that, in the absence of metabolic dysfunction, individuals with excess adiposity are not at greater cardiovascular risk. We tested this hypothesis in a large pan-European prospective study.
   Methods and results We conducted a case-cohort analysis in the 520 000-person European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition study ('EPIC-CVD'). During a median follow-up of 12.2 years, we recorded 7637 incident coronary heart disease (CHD) cases. Using cut-offs recommended by guidelines, we defined obesity and overweight using body mass index (BMI), and metabolic dysfunction ('unhealthy') as >= 3 of elevated blood pressure, hypertriglyceridaemia, low HDL-cholesterol, hyperglycaemia, and elevated waist circumference. We calculated hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) within each country using Prentice-weighted Cox proportional hazard regressions, accounting for age, sex, centre, education, smoking, diet, and physical activity. Compared with metabolically healthy normal weight people (reference), HRs were 2.15 (95% CI: 1.79; 2.57) for unhealthy normal weight, 2.33 (1.97; 2.76) for unhealthy overweight, and 2.54 (2.21; 2.92) for unhealthy obese people. Compared with the reference group, HRs were 1.26 (1.14; 1.40) and 1.28 (1.03; 1.58) for metabolically healthy overweight and obese people, respectively. These results were robust to various sensitivity analyses
   Conclusion Irrespective of BMI, metabolically unhealthy individuals had higher CHD risk than their healthy counterparts. Conversely, irrespective of metabolic health, overweight and obese people had higher CHD risk than lean people. These findings challenge the concept of 'metabolically healthy obesity', encouraging population-wide strategies to tackle obesity.

SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHILOSOPHY
LA English
DT Article
AB The article has two aims. First, to show that a version of luck egalitarianism that includes relational goods amongst its distribuenda can, as a matter of internal logic, account for one of the core beliefs of relational egalitarianism. Therefore, there will be important extensional overlap, at the level of domestic justice, between luck egalitarianism and relational egalitarianism. This is an important consideration in assessing the merits of and relationship between the two rival views. Second, to provide some support for including relational goods, including those advocated by relational egalitarianism, on the distribuenda of justice and therefore to put in a good word for the overall plausibility of this conception of justice. I show why relational egalitarians, too, have reason to sympathise with this proposal.

AB The importance of translational regulation during Arabidopsis seed germination has been shown previously. Here the role of transcriptional and translational regulation during seed imbibition of the very dormant DELAY OF GERMINATION 1 (DOG1) near-isogenic line was investigated.
   Polysome profiling was performed on dormant and after-ripened seeds imbibed for 6 and 24 h in water and in the transcription inhibitor cordycepin. Transcriptome and translatome changes were investigated.
   Ribosomal profiles of after-ripened seeds imbibed in cordycepin mimic those of dormant seeds. The polysome occupancy of mRNA species is not affected by germination inhibition, either as a result of seed dormancy or as a result of cordycepin treatment, indicating the importance of the regulation of transcript abundance.
   The expression of auxin metabolism genes is discriminative during the imbibition of after-ripened and dormant seeds, which is confirmed by altered concentrations of indole-3-acetic acid conjugates and precursors.

AB Line managers' behaviours are important during implementation of occupational health interventions. Still, little is known about how these behaviours are related to intervention outcomes. This study explored the relationship between line managers' intervention-specific transformational leadership (IsTL), intervention fit (the match between the intervention, persons involved, and the surrounding environment), and change in intrinsic motivation and vigour. Both direct and indirect relationships between IsTL and change in intrinsic motivation and vigour were tested. Ninety employees participating in an organizational-level occupational health intervention provided questionnaire ratings at baseline and after 6months. The results showed IsTL to be related to intervention fit and intervention fit to be related to intrinsic motivation. Using intervention fit as a mediator, the total effects (direct and indirect combined) of IsTL on change in intrinsic motivation and vigour were significant. In addition, IsTL had a specific indirect effect on intrinsic motivation. This study is the first to use IsTL as a measure line managers' behaviours. It is also the first to empirically evaluate the association between intervention fit and intervention outcomes. By including these measures in evaluations of organizational-level occupational health interventions, we can provide more informative answers as to what can make interventions successful.

AB Birds are widely used to assess metal contamination in the environment and there are different approaches to determine the exposure level in individuals, some being destructive (collection of soft tissues) and some non-destructive (blood, feathers and excrement). The use of blood to detect internal concentrations of metals is an acknowledged method, but to what extent blood can predict the concentrations in soft tissues has been less well evaluated in wild terrestrial birds. The same is true for excrements. This study compares the non-destructive methods using blood and excrement with liver sampling, with respect to exposure and accumulation of the elements arsenic, cadmium, copper, lead and zinc in nestling pied flycatchers (Ficedula hypoleuca). Blood, liver and excrement reflected the environmental exposure of non-essential elements and were independent of nestling sex. There were asymptotic relationships between the concentration of arsenic, cadmium and lead in liver and blood, excrement and liver, and excrement and blood, but none for copper or zinc. Those relationships were generally stronger between liver and blood than between excrements and internal concentrations. Lead had the strongest associations for all matrixes. The conclusion is that blood is an appropriate tool to assess accumulation of arsenic, cadmium and especially lead, but that blood can underestimate the accumulation at highly contaminated sites. Excrement can also give an indication of metal accumulation, but may overestimate internal concentrations at high exposure, and individual variability makes direct comparisons between these matrices less appropriate.

AB Principal component analysis (PCA) is an exploratory tool widely used in data analysis to uncover the dominant patterns of variability with in a population. Despite its ability to represent a data set in a low-dimensional space, PCA's interpretability remains limited. Indeed, the components produced by PCA are often noisy or exhibit no visually meaningful patterns. Furthermore, the fact that the components are usually non-sparse may also impede interpretation, unless arbitrary thresholding is applied. However, in neuroimaging, it is essential to uncover clinically interpretable phenotypic markers that would account for the main variability in the brain images of a population. Recently, some alternatives to the standard PCA approach, such as sparse PCA (SPCA), have been proposed, their aim being to limit the density of the components. Nonetheless, sparsity alone does not entirely solve the interpretability problem in neuroimaging, since it may yield scattered and unstable components. We hypothesized that the incorporation of prior information regarding the structure of the data may lead to improved relevance and interpretability of brain patterns. We therefore present a simple extension of the popular PCA framework that adds structured sparsity penalties on the loading vectors in order to identify the few stable regions in the brain images that capture most of the variability. Such structured sparsity can be obtained by combining, e.g., l(1) and total variation (TV) penalties, where the TV regularization encodes information on the underlying structure of the data. This paper presents the structured SPCA (denoted SPCA-TV) optimization framework and its resolution. We demonstrate SPCA-TV's effectiveness and versatility on three different data sets. It can be applied to any kind of structured data, such as, e.g., N-dimensional array images or meshes of cortical surfaces. The gains of SPCA-TV over unstructured approaches (such as SPCA and ElasticNet PCA) or structured approach (such as GraphNet PCA) are significant, since SPCA-TV reveals the variability within a data set in the form of intelligible brain patterns that are easier to interpret and more stable across different samples.

AB Chloroplasts develop from undifferentiated proplastids present in meristematic tissue. Thus, chloroplast biogenesis is closely connected to leaf development, which restricts our ability to study the process of chloroplast biogenesis per se. As a consequence, we know relatively little about the regulatory mechanisms behind the establishment of the photosynthetic reactions and how the activities of the two genomes involved are coordinated during chloroplast development. We developed a single cell-based experimental system from Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) with high temporal resolution allowing for investigations of the transition from proplastids to functional chloroplasts. Using this unique cell line, we could show that the establishment of photosynthesis is dependent on a regulatory mechanism involving two distinct phases. The first phase is triggered by rapid light-induced changes in gene expression and the metabolome. The second phase is dependent on the activation of the chloroplast and generates massive changes in the nuclear gene expression required for the transition to photosynthetically functional chloroplasts. The second phase also is associated with a spatial transition of the chloroplasts from clusters around the nucleus to the final position at the cell cortex. Thus, the establishment of photosynthesis is a two-phase process with a clear checkpoint associated with the second regulatory phase allowing coordination of the activities of the nuclear and plastid genomes.

AB Background: It has been asserted that mammography screening preferentially benefits those with less aggressive cancers, with lesser or no impact on more rapidly progressing and therefore more life-threatening tumors.
   Methods: We utilized data from the Swedish Two-County Trial, which randomized 77,080 women ages 40 to 74 to invitation to screening and 55,985 for usual care. We tabulated cancers by histologic grade and then compared mortality from cancers specific to histologic grade between the invited and control group using Poisson regression, with specific interest in the effect on mortality from grade 3 cancers. We used incidence-based mortality from tumors diagnosed within the screening phase of the trial. Finally, we cross-tabulated grade with tumor size and node status, to assess downstaging within tumor grades.
   Results: There was a major reduction in mortality from grade 3 tumors (RR = 0.65; 95% CI, 0.53-0.80; P < 0.001), and more deaths prevented from grade 3 tumors (n = 95) than grade 1 and 2 tumors combined (n = 48) in the invited group. The proportions of tumors >= 15 mm or larger and node-positive tumors were substantially reduced in the grade 3 tumors in the invited group.
   Conclusions: The combination of prevention of tumors progressing to grade 3 and detection at smaller sizes and lesser rates of lymph node metastases within grade 3 tumors results in a substantial number of deaths from grade 3 cancers being prevented by invitation to mammographic screening.
   Impact: Mammography screening prevents deaths from aggressive cancers. (C) 2017 AACR.

AB Both protective and adverse effects of indoor microbial exposure on asthma have been reported, but mostly in children. To date, no study in adults has used non-targeted methods for detection of indoor bacteria followed by quantitative confirmation.
   A cross-sectional study of 198 asthmatic and 199 controls was conducted within the European Community Respiratory Health Survey (ECRHS) II. DNA was extracted from mattress dust for bacterial analysis using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). Selected bands were sequenced and associations with asthma confirmed with four quantitative PCR (qPCR) assays.
   15 out of 37 bands detected with DGGE, which had at least a suggestive association (p<0.25) with asthma, were sequenced. Of the four targeted qPCRs, Clostridium cluster XI confirmed the protective association with asthma. The association was dose dependent (aOR 0.43 (95% CI 0.22-0.84) for the fourth versus first quartile, p for trend 0.009) and independent of other microbial markers. Few significant associations were observed for the three other qPCRs used.
   In this large international study, the level of Clostridium cluster XI was independently associated with a lower risk of prevalent asthma. Results suggest the importance of environmental bacteria also in adult asthma, but need to be confirmed in future studies.

AB Background: We aimed to investigate the influence of preoperative radiological severity and symptom duration of hip osteoarthritis (OA) on the postoperative functional outcome, quality of life, as well as abductor muscle strength after total hip arthroplasty (THA).
   Methods: In this prospective cohort study, we studied 250 patients. Preoperatively, we evaluated the function with the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis (WOMAC) index and quality of life with euroqol-5D (EQ-5D). At 1 year after THA, the same scores and also hip abductor muscle strength were measured in 222 patients. We divided the cohort twice, first according to the radiological OA severity [Kellgren-Lawrence classification (KL)] and then according to the OA symptom duration. We investigated whether the preoperative KL class and symptom duration influenced the 1-year WOMAC (primary outcome measure) or EQ-5D and abductor muscle strength (secondary outcome measures).
   Results: The crude results showed that KL class and symptom duration had no influence (P = .90 and P = .20, respectively) on the 1-yearWOMAC. Younger age, male gender, and lower body mass index were associated with a better function. Regarding 1-year EQ-5D, the crude results showed that body mass index and KL class had no influence (P = .83 and P = .39, respectively). The adjusted results showed that only age and gender influenced the postoperative EQ-5D. No influence of the tested factors was found on the 1-year abductor muscle strength.
   Conclusion: Preoperative radiological OA severity and symptom duration had no influence on the outcome of THA and should probably not affect the decision about timing the operative intervention. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Purpose Little is known regarding movement strategies in the long term following injury of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), and even less about comparisons of reconstructed and deficient knees in relation to healthy controls. The present purpose was to compare trunk, hip, and knee kinematics during a one-leg vertical hop (VH) similar to 20 years post-ACL injury between persons treated with surgery and physiotherapy (ACL(R)), solely physiotherapy (ACL(PT)), and controls (CTRL). Between-leg kinematic differences within groups were also investigated.
   Methods Sixty-six persons who suffered unilateral ACL injury on average 23 +/- 2 years ago (32 ACL(R), 34 ACL(PT)) and 33 controls performed the VH. Peak trunk, hip, and knee angles during Take-off and Landing phases recorded with a 3D motion capture system were analysed with multivariate statistics.
   Results Significant group effects during both Take-off and Landing were found, with ACL(PT) differing from CTRL in Take-off with a combination of less knee flexion and knee internal rotation, and from both ACL(R) and CTRL in Landing with less hip and knee flexion, knee internal rotation, and greater hip adduction. ACL(R) also presented different kinematics to ACL(PT) and CTRL in Take-off with a combination of greater trunk flexion, hip flexion, hip internal rotation, and less knee abduction, and in Landing with greater trunk flexion and hip internal rotation. Further, different kinematics and hop height were found between legs within groups in both Take-off and Landing for both ACL groups, but not for CTRL.
   Conclusion Different kinematics for the injured leg for both ACL groups compared to CTRL and between treatment groups, as well as between legs within treatment groups, indicate long-term consequences of injury. Compensatory mechanisms for knee protection seem to prevail over time irrespective of initial treatment, possibly increasing the risk of re-injury and triggering the development of osteoarthritis. Detailed investigation of movement strategies during the VH provides important information and a more comprehensive evaluation of knee function than merely hop height. More attention should also be given to the trunk and hip in clinics when evaluating movement strategies after ACL injury.

AB A widely held view is that top-down modulation of sensory information relies on an amodal control network that acts through the thalamus to regulate incoming signals. Olfaction lacks a direct thalamic projection, which suggests that it may differ from other modalities in this regard. We investigated the late positive complex (LPC) amplitudes of event-related potentials (ERP) from 28 participants, elicited by intensity-matched olfactory, auditory and visual stimuli, during a condition of focused attention, a neutral condition, and a condition in which stimuli were to be actively ignored. Amplitudes were largest during the attend condition, lowest during the ignore condition, with the neutral condition in between. A Bayesian analysis resulted in strong evidence for similar effects of task across sensory modalities. We conclude that olfaction, despite its unique neural projections, does not differ from audition and vision in terms of task-dependent neural modulation of the LPC.

AB Objective: To determine the prevalence of various environmental intolerances (EIs), using several criteria in a Swedish and a Finnish general population. Ill-health attributed to low-level environmental exposures is a commonly encountered challenge in occupational and environmental medicine.
   Methods: In population-based questionnaire surveys, the Vasterbotten Environmental Health Study (Sweden) and the Osterbotten Environmental Health Study (Finland), EI was inquired by one-item questions on symptom attribution to chemicals, certain buildings, or electromagnetic fields (EMFs), and difficulties tolerating sounds. The respondents were asked whether they react with central nervous system (CNS) symptoms or have a physician-diagnosed EI attributed to the corresponding exposures. Prevalence rates were determined for different age and sex groups and the Swedish and Finnish samples in general.
   Results: In the Swedish sample (n = 3406), 12.2% had self-reported intolerance to chemicals, 4.8% to certain buildings, 2.7% to EMFs, and 9.2% to sounds. The prevalence rates for the Finnish sample (n = 1535) were 15.2%, 7.2%, 1.6%, and 5.4%, respectively, differing statistically significantly from the Swedish. EI to chemicals and certain buildings was more prevalent in Finland, while EI to EMFs and sounds more prevalent in Sweden. The prevalence rates for EI with CNS-symptoms were lower and physician-diagnosed EIs considerably lower than self-reported EIs. Women reported EI more often than men and the young (18-39 years) to a lesser degree than middle-aged and elderly.
   Conclusions: The findings reflect the heterogeneous nature of EI. The differences in EI prevalence between the countries might reflect disparities concerning which exposures people perceive harmful and focus their attention to.

AB Indoor air pollution has caused increasing concern in recent years. As we spend most of our lives indoors, it is crucial to understand the health effects caused by indoor air pollution. Household dust serve as good proxy for accessing indoor air pollution, especially smaller dust particles that can pass into the lungs are of interest. In this study we present an efficient method for the isolation of dust particles in the respirable size range. The respirable fraction was recovered from vacuum cleaner bags, separated by stepwise sieving, followed by characterization for size, morphology, surface area, organic content and elemental composition. The respirable fraction was obtained in a yield of 0.6% with a specific surface area of 2.5 m(2)/g and a Mass Median Aerodynamic Diameter of 3.73 +/- 0.15 mu m. Aluminum and zink were the dominating metals measured in the dust, whereas the major mineral components were found to be silicon dioxide and calcium carbonate. The fraction of organic matter in the dust was measured to be 69 +/- 1%. The organic matrix contained bacterial and fungi and a presence of skin fragments. We present here an efficient and fast method for the isolation of dust particles in the respirable size range. That is of considerable value due to the need for large quantities of respirable particle fractions to conduct toxicological studies and risk assessment work.

AB We study the containment, satisfiability, and validity problems for conjunctive queries over trees with respect to a schema. We show that conjunctive query containment and validity are 2EXPTIME -complete with respect to a schema, in both cases where the schema is given as a DTD or as a tree automaton. Furthermore, we show that satisfiability for conjunctive queries with respect to a schema can be decided in NP . The problem is NP -hard already for queries using only one kind of axis. Finally, we consider conjunctive queries that can test for equalities and inequalities of data values. Here, satisfiability and validity are decidable, but containment is undecidable, even without schema information. On the other hand, containment with respect to a schema becomes decidable again if the "larger" query is not allowed to use both equalities and inequalities.

DE Roman; Insects; Well; Wood pasture; Sherwood Forest; Landscape change
ID BRITAIN; ENGLAND; DIPTERA
AB Sherwood Forest in Nottinghamshire is often considered a well-preserved ancient landscape, subsequently having survived by way of centuries of management as a hunting preserve. Archaeological evidence suggests otherwise, with an enclosed landscape beginning in the pre-Roman Iron Age and continuing through the Roman period. Due to the nature of the region's soils, however, there is little empirical, palaeoecological evidence on its environmental history prior to the medieval period. This paper presents an insect fauna from a Roman well in a small enclosure in north Nottinghamshire, on the edge of Sherwood Forest, and its interpretation in terms of contemporary land use. Wells and small pools act as large pitfall traps and may effectively sample aspects of the local and regional insect fauna. The Wild Goose Cottage fauna and its environmental implications are also compared with a number of archaeologically and geographically similar contexts.

AB Objective
   To investigate whether curative prostate cancer (PCa) treatment was received less often by men with both PCa and Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) as little is known about the influence of T2DM diagnosis on the receipt of such treatment in men with localized PCa.
   Subjects and Methods
   The Prostate Cancer database Sweden (PCBaSe) was used to obtain data on men with T2DM and PCa (n = 2210) for comparison with data on men with PCa only (n = 23 071). All men had intermediate-(T1-2, Gleason score 7 and/or prostate-specific antigen [PSA] 10-20 ng/mL) or high-risk (T3 and/or Gleason score 8-10 and/or PSA 20-50 ng/mL) localized PCa diagnosed between 1 January 2006 and 31 December 2014. Multivariate logistic regression was used to calculate the odds ratios (ORs) for receipt of curative treatment in men with and without T2DM. Overall survival, for up to 8 years of follow-up, was calculated both for men with T2DM only and for men with T2DM and PCa.
   Results
   Men with T2DM were less likely to receive curative treatment for PCa than men without T2DM (OR 0.78, 95% confidence interval 0.69-0.87). The 8-year overall survival rates were 79% and 33% for men with T2DM and high-risk PCa who did and did not receive curative treatment, respectively.
   Conclusions
   Men with T2DM were less likely to receive curative treatment for localized intermediate-and high-risk PCa. Men with T2DM and high-risk PCa who received curative treatment had substantially higher survival times than those who did not. Some of the survival differences represent a selection bias, whereby the healthiest patients received curative treatment. Clinicians should interpret this data carefully and ensure that individual patients with T2DM and PCa are not under-nor overtreated.

AB We extend recent advances in time substitution modeling to a directional distance function framework, in order to examine the environmental performance of firms in Sweden's pulp and paper industry for the years 2002-2008. Our data allow us to estimate the optimal reallocation of environmental investments, expenditures and energy use to simultaneously maximize production output and minimize emissions in the years immediately before and after the implementation of the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme. We find some evidence of overall productivity decline when considering both emissions and output objectives, due primarily to technological decline, and that cumulative dynamic inefficiency outweighs static inefficiency. A comparison of optimal investment with observed investment indicates that firms could have improved their performance by reallocating environmental investments to early periods and production-oriented investment to later periods.

AB Morgenstern et al. (J Environ Econ Manag 43:412-436, 2002. doi: 10.1006/jeem.2001.1191) are well-known for its investigation of the employment effects of environmental regulations. However, the cost function specified in that paper is handicapped by its reliance on survey data of the costs of inputs assigned to pollution abatement. In this paper, we specify an input distance function that models the joint production of good and bad outputs. This allows us to measure the relative importance of factors associated with changes in employment without pollution abatement cost data. We operationalize our model using a sample of 80 coal-fired electric power plants from 1995 to 2005.

AB Ribonucleotide reductases (RNRs) are key enzymes in DNA metabolism, with allosteric mechanisms controlling substrate specificity and overall activity. In RNRs, the activity master-switch, the ATP-cone, has been found exclusively in the catalytic subunit. In two class I RNR subclasses whose catalytic subunit lacks the ATP-cone, we discovered ATP-cones in the radical-generating subunit. The ATP-cone in the Leeuwenhoekiella blandensis radical-generating subunit regulates activity via quaternary structure induced by binding of nucleotides. ATP induces enzymatically competent dimers, whereas dATP induces non-productive tetramers, resulting in different holoenzymes. The tetramer forms by interactions between ATP-cones, shown by a 2.45 A crystal structure. We also present evidence for an (MnMnIV)-Mn-III metal center. In summary, lack of an ATP-cone domain in the catalytic subunit was compensated by transfer of the domain to the radical-generating subunit. To our knowledge, this represents the first observation of transfer of an allosteric domain between components of the same enzyme complex.

AB Cattle manure value chains play important biological and economic roles in smallholder crop-livestock systems in developing countries, but relative to other livestock products our understanding of the nature and impact of manure sales is limited. In regions with an active manure trade, farmers face a choice between manure use on-farm and sales, which affects nutrient flows and participant incomes. We analyzed the manure value chain operating in south-central Vietnam as an example of the function and role of manure trade in crop-livestock systems. Lowland cattle farmers sell manure through a network of chain participants, including small-scale collectors, lowland and highland traders, to pepper, coffee, dragon fruit and rubber farms in the central highlands and southeast coast. We collected and summarized quantitative data (e.g., manure-related labor, manure transactions, and fertilizer and manure use) gathered in semi-structured interviews with value-chain participants [lowland cattle owners (n=101), traders (n=27) and end users (n=72)]. Lowland cattle owners were selected by stratified random sampling, and subsequent participants were identified in preceding interviews. One key finding concerns the seasonality of the manure value chain: most manure flowed between February and August (lowland dry season and period of peak highland demand) from lowland communes to highland coffee and pepper farms for use as organic soil amendments. Fewer sales occurred, at a lower price, to southeast coastal dragon fruit farms and rubber companies. Value addition to manure occurred via drying, bagging, collection, transport and composting. The presence of local traders facilitated market sales for smallholder cattle owners, and prices through the value chain generally reflected costs for value addition. The geographic distribution of cattle relative to agricultural land influenced the flow of manure, with net outflows from regions with higher animal density to regions with lower density and higher value crop production. Manure trade was an important source of supplementary income for farmers and a primary livelihood activity for traders. Value chain participant net incomes ranged from near US$100yr(-1) for lowland farmers to over US$13,000yr(-1) for traders, and returns to labor were just over US$0.50h(-1) for lowland farmers and US$2h(-1) for traders. The quantitative information generated during our descriptive assessment provides an important first step toward manure value chain improvement, indicates survey methods that can be applied in other areas, and identifies next steps necessary to evaluate chain evolution and resilience.

AB Background. Central nervous system (CNS) complications are increasingly noted in liver transplanted (LTx) hereditary transthyretin amyloid (ATTRm) amyloidosis patients; this suggests that the increased survival allows for intracranial ATTRm formation from brain synthesized mutant TTR. However, atrial fibrillation (AF), a recognised risk factor for ischemic CNS complications, is also observed after LTx. The aim of the study was to investigate the occurrence of CNS complications and AF in LTx ATTRm amyloidosis patients. Methods. The medical records of all LTx ATTRm amyloidosis patients in the county of Vasterbotten, Sweden, were investigated for information on CNS complications, AF, anticoagulation (AC) therapy, hypertension, cardiac ischemic disease, hypertrophy, and neurological status. Results. Sixty-three patients that had survived for 3 years or longer after LTx were included in the analysis. Twenty-five patients had developed 1 or more CNS complications at a median of 21 years after onset of disease. AF was noted in 21 patients (median time to diagnosis 24 years). Cerebrovascular events (CVE) developed in 17 (median time to event 21 years). CVEs occurred significantly more often in patients with AF (P < 0.002). AC therapy significantly reduced CVEs, including bleeding in patients with AF (P = 0.04). Multivariate analysis identified AF as the only remaining regressor with a significant impact on CVE (hazard ratio, 3.8; 95% confidence interval 1.1-9.5; P = 0.029). Conclusions. AF is an important risk factor for CVE in LTx ATTRm amyloidosis patients, and AC therapy should be considered. However, the increased bleeding risk with AC therapy in patients with intracranial amyloidosis should be acknowledged.

AB Background and Aims: Population-based prospective cohort studies investigating fibre intake and development of inflammatory bowel disease are lacking. Our aim was to investigate the association between fibre intake and the development of Crohn's disease [CD] and ulcerative colitis [UC] in a large European population.
   Methods: In total, 401 326 participants, aged 20-80 years, were recruited in eight countries in Europe between 1991 and 1998. At baseline, fibre intake [total fibres, fibres from fruit, vegetables and cereals] was recorded using food frequency questionnaires. The cohort was monitored for the development of inflammatory bowel disease. Each case was matched with four controls and odds ratios [ORs] for the exposures were calculated using conditional logistic regression. Sensitivity analyses according to smoking status were computed.
   Results: In total, 104 and 221 participants developed incident CD and UC, respectively. For both CD and UC, there were no statistically significant associations with either quartiles, or trends across quartiles, for total fibre or any of the individual sources. The associations were not affected by adjusting for smoking and energy intake. Stratification according to smoking status showed null findings apart from an inverse association with cereal fibre and CD in non-smokers [Quartile 4 vs 1 OR = 0.12, 95% confidence interval = 0.02-0.75, p = 0.023, OR trend across quartiles = 0.50, 95% confidence interval = 0.29-0.86, p = 0.017].
   Conclusion: The results do not support the hypothesis that dietary fibre is involved in the aetiology of UC, although future work should investigate whether there may be a protective effect of specific types of fibre according to smoking status in CD.

AB Background. DPD scintigraphy has been advocated for imaging cardiac amyloid in ATTR amyloidosis. PET utilizing 11 C-Pittsburgh compound B (PIB) is the gold standard for imaging brain amyloid in Alzheimer's disease. PIB was recently shown to identify cardiac amyloidosis in both AL and ATTR amyloidosis. In the ATTR population, two types of amyloid fibrils exist, one containing fragmented and full-length TTR (type A) and the other only full-length TTR (type B). The aim of this study was to further evaluate PIB-PET in patients with hereditary ATTR amyloidosis.
   Methods. Ten patients with biopsy-proven V30M ATTR amyloidosis and discrete or no signs of cardiac involvement were included. Patients were grouped according to TTR-fragmentation. All underwent DPD scintigraphy, echocardiography, and PIB-PET. A left ventricular PIB-retention index (PIB-RI) was established and compared to five normal volunteers.
   Results. PIB-RI was increased in all patients (P < 0.001), but was significantly higher in type B than in type A (0.129 +/- 0.041 vs 0.040 +/- 0.006 min 21, P = 0.009). Cardiac DPD uptake was elevated in group A and absent in group B.
   Conclusion. PIB-PET, in contrast to DPD scintigraphy, has the potential to specifically identify cardiac amyloid depositions irrespective of amyloid fibril composition. The heart appears to be a target organ for amyloid deposition in ATTR amyloidosis.

AB The purpose of this study is to investigate features of transaction costs (fees and taxes) regarding real estate deals and to analyze transaction costs in the real estate market in emerging and established economies in order to research the link between the extent of market development and transaction costs. The authors' methodological approach to estimation of transaction costs consists of qualitative and quantitative stages and is based on descriptive, normative and statistical information, which allows estimation and comparison of transaction costs as well as their structure and sources of occurrence by types. The two cases were chosen for practical implementation of the method: a transition economy of Belarus and a relatively established market economy of Poland. In order to measure transaction costs, the authors use the example of a residential'property in order to provide a comparable basis for further analysis. Application of the method to the most prevalent pattern of real estate deals shows sufficient comparability of transaction costs (ca. 2.5%) and a slight difference (ca. 4%) caused by the absence of transaction tax in Belarus.

AB Atherothrombosis is a leading cause of cardiovascular mortality and long-term morbidity. Platelets and coagulation proteases, interacting with circulating cells and in different vascular beds, modify several complex pathologies including atherosclerosis. In the second Maastricht Consensus Conference on Thrombosis, this theme was addressed by diverse scientists from bench to bedside. All presentations were discussed with audience members and the results of these discussions were incorporated in the final document that presents a state-of-the-art reflection of expert opinions and consensus recommendations regarding the following five topics:
   1. Risk factors, biomarkers and plaque instability: In atherothrombosis research, more focus on the contribution of specific risk factors like ectopic fat needs to be considered; definitions of atherothrombosis are important distinguishing different phases of disease, including plaque (in) stability; proteomic and metabolomics data are to be added to genetic information.
   2. Circulating cells including platelets and atherothrombosis: Mechanisms of leukocyte and macrophage plasticity, migration, and transformation in murine atherosclerosis need to be considered; diseasemechanism-based biomarkers need to be identified; experimental systems are needed that incorporatewhole-blood flow to understand how red blood cells influence thrombus formation and stability; knowledge on platelet heterogeneity and priming conditions needs to be translated toward the in vivo situation.
   3. Coagulation proteases, fibrin(ogen) and thrombus formation: The role of factor (F) XI in thrombosis including the lower margins of this factor related to safe and effective antithrombotic therapy needs to be established; FXI is a key regulator in linking platelets, thrombin generation, and inflammatory mechanisms in a renin-angiotensin dependent manner; however, the impact on thrombin-dependent PAR signaling needs further study; the fundamental mechanisms in FXIII biology and biochemistry and its impact on thrombus biophysical characteristics need to be explored; the interactions of red cells and fibrin formation and its consequences for thrombus formation and lysis need to be addressed. Platelet-fibrin interactions are pivotal determinants of clot formation and stability with potential therapeutic consequences.
   4. Preventive and acute treatment of atherothrombosis and arterial embolism; novel ways and tailoring? The role of protease-activated receptor (PAR)-4 vis a vis PAR-1 as target for antithrombotic therapy merits study; ongoing trials on platelet function test-based antiplatelet therapy adjustment support development of practically feasible tests; risk scores for patients with atrial fibrillation need refinement, taking new biomarkers including coagulation into account; risk scores that consider organ system differences in bleeding may have added value; all forms of oral anticoagulant treatment require better organization, including education and emergency access; laboratory testing still needs rapidly available sensitive tests with short turnaround time.
   5. Pleiotropy of coagulation proteases, thrombus resolution and ischaemia-reperfusion: Biobanks specifically for thrombus storage and analysis are needed; further studies on novelmodified activated protein C-based agents are required including its cytoprotective properties; new avenues for optimizing treatment of patients with ischaemic stroke are needed, also including novel agents that modify fibrinolytic activity (aimed at plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 and thrombin activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor.

AB Objective The aim of this study was to investigate and compare the mechanical responses of dorsal neck muscles in individuals with whiplash-associated disorders (WAD) versus healthy individuals.
   Design This study included 36 individuals with WAD (26 women and 10 men) and 36 healthy controls (26 women and 10 men). Ultrasound imaging with speckle tracking was used to measure deformation and deformation rate in five dorsal neck muscles during a neck extension task.
   Results Compared with controls, individuals with WAD showed higher deformations of the semispinalis cervicis (P = 0.02) and multifidus (P = 0.002) muscles and higher deformation rates (P = 0.03 and 0.0001, respectively). Among individuals with WAD, multifidus deformation and deformation rate were significantly associated with pain, disability, and fatigue (r = 0.31-0.46, P = 0.0001-0.01).
   Conclusions These findings indicate that the mechanical responses of the deep dorsal neck muscles differ between individuals with WAD and healthy controls, possibly reflecting that these muscles use altered strategies while performing a neck extension task.

AB BackgroundThere is growing interest in exposures prior to conception as possible risk factors for offspring asthma. Although partially supported by evidence from limited human studies, current evidence is inconsistent and based on recall of exposure status.
   ObjectiveWe aimed to investigate grandmaternal smoking during pregnancy and the risk of asthma in grandchildren using prospectively collected population-based data.
   MethodsInformation on grandmaternal and maternal smoking during pregnancy and grandchild use of asthma medications was collected from national Swedish registries. Associations between grandmaternal smoking during pregnancy (10-12weeks) and asthma medication use in grandchildren were investigated using generalized estimating equations. Ages at which asthma medications were prescribed classified childhood asthma into never, early transient (0-3years), late onset (3-6years) and early persistent (0-3 and 3-6years) phenotypes.
   ResultsFrom 1982 to 1986, 44583 grandmothers gave birth to 46197 mothers, who gave birth to 66271 grandchildren (born 1996-2010). Children aged 1-6years had an increased asthma risk if their grandmothers had smoked during pregnancy, with a higher risk for more exposure (10+cigs/d; adjusted OR 1.23; 1.17, 1.30). Maternal smoking did not modify this relationship.
   Conclusions & Clinical RelevanceChildren had an increased risk of asthma in the first 6years of life if their grandmothers smoked during early pregnancy, independent of maternal smoking. Importantly, this exhibited a dose-response relationship and was associated with a persistent childhood asthma phenotype. These findings support possible epigenetic transmission of risk from environmental exposures in previous generations.

AB By comparing two large-scale professional development programs' content and impact on student achievement, we contribute to research on critical features of high quality professional development, especially content focus. Even though the programs are conducted in the same context and are highly similar if characterized according to established research frameworks, our results suggest that they differ in their impact on student achievement. We therefore develop an analytical framework that allow us to characterize the programs' content and delivery in detail. Through this approach, we identify important differences between the programs that provide explanatory value in discussing reasons for their differing impacts. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background/Aim: KRAS and BRAF are two genes commonly mutated in colorectal cancer (CRC). Even though BRAF is a downstream target of KRAS in the MAPK signalling pathway, KRAS- and BRAF-mutated CRCs are found to display several different clinical and histopathological features. We investigated whether a differential expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) could explain the clinicopathological differences seen between KRAS-and BRAF-mutated CRCs. Materials and Methods: Using a PCR array, we analyzed the expression of 84 different miRNAs in CRC cell lines wild-type in KRAS and BRAF, or mutated in KRAS or BRAF. Results: Ten miRNAs were selected for further analyses in tumor tissue specimens (let-7a, let-7i, miR-10a, miR-10b, miR-31, miR-100, miR-181a, miR-181b, miR-372, and miR-373). BRAF-mutated tumors were found to express significantly higher levels of miR-31 as well as significantly lower levels of miR-373, compared to wild-type tumors. Conclusion: Our results suggest that KRAS and BRAF-mutated CRCs may have different miRNA signatures compared to CRC tumors wild-type in KRAS and BRAF. However, no difference in expression levels between KRAS-and BRAF-mutated tumors was evident for the miRNAs analyzed in this study.

AB The development of ultra-short intense laser sources in the visible and extreme ultraviolet (XUV) spectral range has led to fascinating studies in laser-matter interactions and attosecond science. In the majority of these studies, the system under investigation interacts with a focused light beam, which ionizes the system. The ionization products are usually measured by devices, which spatiotemporally integrate the ionization signal originating from the entire focal area, discarding in this way valuable information about the ionization dynamics that take place in the interaction volume. Here, we review a recently developed approach in measuring the spatially resolved photoionization yields resulting from the interaction of infrared (IR)/XUV ultra-short light pulses in gas phase media. We show how this approach enables (a) the in situ focus diagnostic, (b) quantitative studies of linear and non-linear ionization processes in the IR/XUV regime, (c) single-shot XUV-pump-XUV-probe studies and (d) single-shot 2nd-order XUV autocorrelation measurements.

AB The sense of self is vulnerable in people with Alzheimer's disease (AD), and might be positively and negatively influenced by research participation. The purpose of this study was to describe how people with AD express their experience of being a research participant with respect to their sense of self. Interviews and support group conversations involving 13 people with mild and moderate AD were analyzed using qualitative content analysis. Three themes were constructed: contributing to an important cause, gaining from participating, and experiencing risks and drawbacks. Participants described contributing to research as being in line with their lifelong values and lifestyles. They expressed contentment and pride about being research participants, emphasized their positive relationships with the researchers, and described participation as a meaningful activity. When research procedures threatened their sense of self, they were able to reason about risks and decline participation.

AB Two new acceptor-pi(donor)-donor-,pi(donor)-acceptor small molecules SM1 and SM2 with benzodithiophene (BDT) donor core unit linked via phenothiazine (PTZ) donor units with 1,3-indanedione and malononitrile end capping units, respectively, have been designed and synthesized and used as electron donor along with PC71BM as acceptor for solution-processed bulk heterojunction organic solar cells. The influence of these end-capping groups on their thermal, optical, electrochemical properties and photovoltaic performance was investigated. After the optimization of the donor to acceptor weight ratio and solvent vapor annealing, the organic solar cells based on SM1:PC71BM and SM2:PC71BM active layers showed the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 6.20% and 7.45%, respectively. Hence, the end-capping acceptor units for the two small molecules revealed a significant influence on the PCE of the organic solar cells, which resulted from differences in film absorption, molecular packing and charge transport properties.

AB Repetitive DNA, represented by transposons and satellite DNA, constitutes a large portion of eukaryotic genomes, being the major component of constitutive heterochromatin. There is a growing body of evidence that it regulates several nuclear functions including chromatin state and the proper functioning of centromeres and telomeres. The 1.688 satellite is one of the most abundant repetitive sequences in Drosophila melanogaster, with the longest array being located in the pericentromeric region of the X-chromosome. Short arrays of 1.688 repeats are widespread within the euchromatic part of the X-chromosome, and these arrays were recently suggested to assist in recognition of the X-chromosome by the dosage compensation male-specific lethal complex. We discovered that a short array of 1.688 satellite repeats is essential for recruitment of the protein POF to a previously described site on the X-chromosome (PoX2) and to various transgenic constructs. On an isolated target, i.e., an autosomic transgene consisting of a gene upstream of 1.688 satellite repeats, POF is recruited to the transgene in both males and females. The sequence of the satellite, as well as its length and position within the recruitment element, are the major determinants of targeting. Moreover, the 1.688 array promotes POF targeting to the roX1-proximal PoX1 site in trans. Finally, binding of POF to the 1.688-related satellite-enriched sequences is conserved in evolution. We hypothesize that the 1.688 satellite functioned in an ancient dosage compensation system involving POF targeting to the X-chromosome.

AB Late displacement of distal radius fractures, still in acceptable radiological position after 1-2 weeks, occurs in approximately one-third of cases. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of late displacement on the functional outcome and quality of life at 1 year in non-operatively treated distal radius fractures. One hundred and seventy five unilateral conservatively treated distal radius fractures with minimal displacement after 10-14 days were finally evaluated in the study. Follow-up included radiographs at 3 months and clinical examination 1 year after the fracture. Final radiographic parameters, grip strength, range of motion, QuickDASH, EQ-5D and pain visual analogue scale were evaluated with multivariate analysis. Late displacement occurred in 28% of the cases and was associated with loss of grip strength and range of motion. No significant differences were seen in the outcome questionnaires.

AB Past work linking exercise identity and exercise motivation has been cross-sectional. This is the first study to model the relations between different types of exercise identity and exercise motivation longitudinally. Understanding the dynamic associations between these sets of variables has implications for theory development and applied research. This was a longitudinal survey study. Participants were 180 exercisers (79 men, 101 women) from Greece, who were recruited from fitness centers and were asked to complete questionnaires assessing exercise identity (exercise beliefs and role-identity) and exercise motivation (intrinsic, identified, introjected, external motivation, and amotivation) three times within a 6month period. Multilevel growth curve modeling examined the role of motivational regulations as within- and between-level predictors of exercise identity, and a model in which exercise identity predicted exercise motivation at the within- and between-person levels. Results showed that within-person changes in intrinsic motivation, introjected, and identified regulations were positively and reciprocally related to within-person changes in exercise beliefs; intrinsic motivation was also a positive predictor of within-person changes in role-identity but not vice versa. Between-person differences in the means of predictor variables were predictive of initial levels and average rates of change in the outcome variables. The findings show support to the proposition that a strong exercise identity (particularly exercise beliefs) can foster motivation for behaviors that reinforce this identity. We also demonstrate that such relations can be reciprocal overtime and can depend on the type of motivation in question as well as between-person differences in absolute levels of these variables.

AB Introduction and hypothesis Surgical work encompasses important aspects of personal and manual skills. In major surgery, there is a positive correlation between surgical experience and results. For pelvic organ prolapse (POP), this relationship has to our knowledge never been examined. In any clinical practice, there is always a certain proportion of inexperienced surgeons. In Sweden, most prolapse surgeons have little experience in performing prolapse operations, 74% conducting the procedure once a month or less. Simultaneously, surgery for POP globally has failure rates of 25-30%. In other words, for most surgeons, the operation is a low-frequency procedure, and outcomes are unsatisfactory. The aim of this study was to clarify the acceptability of having a high proportion of low-volume surgeons in the management of POP.
   Methods A group of 14,676 exclusively primary anterior or posterior repair patients was assessed. Data were analyzed by logistic regression and as a group analysis.
   Results Experienced surgeons had shorter operation times and hospital stays. Surgical experience did not affect surgical or patient-reported complication rates, organ damage, reoperation, rehospitalization, or patient satisfaction, nor did it improve patient-reported failure rates 1 year after surgery. Assistant experience, similarly, had no effect on the outcome of the operation.
   Conclusions A management model for isolated anterior or posterior POP surgery that includes a high proportion of low-volume surgeons does not have a negative impact on the quality or outcome of anterior or posterior colporrhaphy. Consequently, the high recurrence rate was not due to insufficient experience of the surgeons performing the operation.

AB Purpose: To investigate the effect of magnetic resonance system-and patient-induced susceptibility distortions from a 3T scanner on dose distributions for prostate cancers.
   Methods and Materials: Combined displacement fields from the residual system and patient-induced susceptibility distortions were used to distort 17 prostate patient CT images. VMAT dose plans were initially optimized on distorted CT images and the plan parameters transferred to the original patient CT images to calculate a new dose distribution.
   Results: Maximum residual mean distortions of 3.19 mm at a radial distance of 25 cm and maximum mean patient-induced susceptibility shifts of 5.8 mm were found using the lowest bandwidth of 122 Hz per pixel. There was a dose difference of <0.5% between distorted and undistorted treatment plans. The 90% confidence intervals of the mean difference between the dCT and CT treatment plans were all within an equivalence interval of (-0.5, 0.5) for all investigated plan quality measures.
   Conclusions: Patient-induced susceptibility distortions at high field strengths in closed bore magnetic resonance scanners are larger than residual system distortions after using vendor-supplied 3-dimensional correction for the delineated regions studied. However, errors in dose due to disturbed patient outline and shifts caused by patient-induced susceptibility effects are below 0.5%. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

ID RESISTANCE; EUROPE
AB Comparative information on diagnosis-related antibiotic prescribing patterns are scarce from primary care within and between countries. To describe and compare antibiotic prescription and routine management of infections in primary care in Latvia (LV), Lithuania (LT) and two study sites in Sweden (SE), a cross-sectional observational study on patients who consulted due to sypmtoms compatible with infection was undetraken. Infection and treatment was detected and recorded by physicians only. Data was collected from altogether 8786 consecutive patients with infections in the three countries. Although the overall proportion of patients receiving an antibiotic prescription was similar in all three countries (LV and LT 42%, SE 38%), there were differences in the rate of prescription between the countries depending on the respective diagnoses. While penicillins dominated among prescriptions (LV 58%, LT 67%, SE 70%), phenoxymethylpenicillin was most commonly prescribed in Sweden (57% of all penicillins), while it was amoxicillin with or without clavulanic acid in Latvia (99%) and Lithuania (85%) respectively. Pivmecillinam and flucloxacillin, which accounted for 29% of penicillins in Sweden, were available neither in Latvia nor in Lithuania. The applied methodology was simple, and provided useful information on differences in treatment of common infections in ambulatory care in the absence of available computerized diagnosis-prescription data. Despite some limitations, the method can be used for assessment of intention to treat and compliance to treatment guidelines and benchmarking locally, nationally, or internationally, just as the point prevalence surveys (PPS) protocols have been used in hospitals all over Europe.

AB In agricultural and natural systems researchers have demonstrated large effects of plant-soil feedback (PSF) on plant growth. However, the concepts and approaches used in these two types of systems have developed, for the most part, independently. Here, we present a conceptual framework that integrates knowledge and approaches from these two contrasting systems. We use this integrated framework to demonstrate (i) how knowledge from complex natural systems can be used to increase agricultural resource-use efficiency and productivity and (ii) how research in agricultural systems can be used to test hypotheses and approaches developed in natural systems. Using this framework, we discuss avenues for new research toward an ecologically sustainable and climate-smart future.

AB This study evaluated the relationship between utilizable crude protein (uCP) at the duodenum estimated in vitro and omasal flow of crude protein (CP; omasal flow of nonammonia N x 6.25) measured in lactating dairy cows. In vivo data were obtained from previous studies estimating omasal digesta flow using a triple-marker method and N-15 as microbial marker. A total of 34 different diets based on grass and red clover silages were incubated with buffered rumen fluid previously preincubated with carbohydrates for 3 h. The buffer solution was modified to contain 38 g of NaHCO3 and 1 g of (NH4) HCO3 in 1,000 mL of distilled water. Continuous sampling of the liquid phase for determination of ammonia-N was performed at 0.5, 4, 8, 12, 24, and 30 h after the start of incubation. The ammonia N concentrations after incubation were used to calculate uCP. The natural logarithm of uCP [g/kg of dry matter (DM)] at time points 0.5, 4, 8, 12, 24, and 30 h of incubation was plotted against time to estimate the concentration of uCP (g/kg of DM) at time points 16, 20, and 24 h using an exponential function. Fixed model regression analysis and mixed model regression analysis with random study effect were used to evaluate the relationships between predicted uCP (supply and concentration) and observed omasal CP flow and milk protein yield. Residual analysis was also conducted to evaluate whether any dietary factors influenced the relationships. The in vitro uCP method ranked the diets accurately in terms of total omasal CP flow (kg/d) or omasal CP flow per kilogram of DM intake. We also noted a close relationship between estimated uCP supply and adjusted omasal CP flow, as demonstrated by a coefficient of determination of 0.87, although the slope of 0.77 indicated that estimated uCP supply (kg/d) was greater than the value determined in vivo. The linear bias with mixed model analysis indicated that uCP supply overestimated the difference in omasal CP flow between the diets within a study, an error most likely related to study differences in feed intake, animals, and methodology. Predicting milk protein yield from uCP supply showed a positive relationship using a mixed model (coefficient of determination = 0.79), and we observed no difference in model fit between the time points of incubation (16, 20, or 24 h). The results of this study indicate that the in vitro method can be a useful tool in evaluating protein value of ruminant diets.

AB The objective of this experiment was to quantify the effects of graded replacement of late-harvested grass silage and barley with early-harvested silage on nutrient digestion and rumen fermentation. Four experimental diets were fed to 4 multiparous rumen-cannulated Nordic Red cows in 4 x 4 Latin square design with 21-d periods. Dietary treatments consisted of late-cut grass silage (LS) and rolled barley, which was gradually replaced with early-cut grass silage [ES; 0, 33, 67, and 100% of the forage component (ES + LS) of the diet]. With increased proportion of ES in the diet, the proportion of barley decreased from 47.2 to 26.6% on a dry matter basis. Early-and late-cut silages were harvested at 2-wk intervals (predicted concentrations of metabolizable energy 11.0 and 9.7 MJ/kg of dry matter). The 4 diets were formulated to support the same milk production. Nutrient flows were quantified using omasal sampling technique applying the triple-marker method (Cr, Yb, and indigestible neutral detergent fiber) and N-15 as a microbial marker. Feed intake decreased with graded replacement of LS and barley with ES, but milk production was not influenced by diet. Digestibility of nutrients improved with graded addition of ES in the diet with the greatest difference observed in digestibility of neutral detergent fiber (NDF) and potentially digestible NDF (pdNDF). The results suggested that improved cell wall digestibility with graded level of ES in the diet was partly related to higher intrinsic digestibility of ES than LS, and partly due to negative associative effects with an increased proportion of LS and barley in the diet. Efficiency of microbial N synthesis was not influenced by the diet, but ruminal protein degradability increased with ES in the diet. Rumen fermentation pattern was not affected by the diet despite large difference in the profile of dietary carbohydrates. Rumen pool size of NDF and pdNDF, and ruminal turnover time of NDF decreased with graded addition of ES in the diet, whereas digestion rate of pdNDF improved. The results of this study indicate that increased CH4 yield in a parallel production study with graded addition of ES in the diet were more related to greater ruminal and total digestibility of organic matter than to the changes in rumen fermentation pattern.

AB The 6th annual meeting to address key issues in positron emission tomography (PET)/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was held again in Tubingen, Germany, from March 27 to 29, 2017. Over three days of invited plenary lectures, round table discussions and dialogue board deliberations, participants critically assessed the current state of PET/MRI, both clinically and as a research tool, and attempted to chart future directions. The meeting addressed the use of PET/MRI and workflows in oncology, neurosciences, infection, inflammation and chronic pain syndromes, as well as deeper discussions about how best to characterise the tumour microenvironment, optimise the complementary information available from PET and MRI, and how advanced data mining and bioinformatics, as well as information from liquid biomarkers (circulating tumour cells and nucleic acids) and pathology, can be integrated to give a more complete characterisation of disease phenotype. Some issues that have dominated previous meetings, such as the accuracy of MR-based attenuation correction (AC) of the PET scan, were finally put to rest as having been adequately addressed for the majority of clinical situations. Likewise, the ability to standardise PET systems for use in multicentre trials was confirmed, thus removing a perceived barrier to larger clinical imaging trials. The meeting openly questioned whether PET/MRI should, in all cases, be used as a whole-body imaging modality or whether in many circumstances it would best be employed to give an in-depth study of previously identified disease in a single organ or region. The meeting concluded that there is still much work to be done in the integration of data from different fields and in developing a common language for all stakeholders involved. In addition, the participants advocated joint training and education for individuals who engage in routine PET/MRI. It was agreed that PET/MRI can enhance our understanding of normal and disrupted biology, and we are in a position to describe the in vivo nature of disease processes, metabolism, evolution of cancer and the monitoring of response to pharmacological interventions and therapies. As such, PET/MRI is a key to advancing medicine and patient care.

AB The emergence of high-throughput DNA sequencing methods provides unprecedented opportunities to further unravel bacterial biodiversity and its worldwide role from human health to ecosystem functioning. However, despite the abundance of sequencing studies, combining data from multiple individual studies to address macroecological questions of bacterial diversity remains methodically challenging and plagued with biases. Here, using a machine-learning approach that accounts for differences among studies and complex interactions among taxa, we merge 30 independent bacterial data sets comprising 1,998 soil samples from 21 countries. Whereas previous meta-analysis efforts have focused on bacterial diversity measures or abundances of major taxa, we show that disparate amplicon sequence data can be combined at the taxonomy-based level to assess bacterial community structure. We find that rarer taxa are more important for structuring soil communities than abundant taxa, and that these rarer taxa are better predictors of community structure than environmental factors, which are often confounded across studies. We conclude that combining data from independent studies can be used to explore bacterial community dynamics, identify potential 'indicator' taxa with an important role in structuring communities, and propose hypotheses on the factors that shape bacterial biogeography that have been overlooked in the past.

AB Aim: We provide the first European-scale geospatial training set relating the charcoal signal in surface lake sediments to fire parameters (number, intensity and area) recorded by satellite moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensors. Our calibration is intended for quantitative reconstructions of key fire-regime parameters by using sediment sequences of microscopic (MIC from pollen slides, particles 10-500 mu m) and macroscopic charcoal (MAC from sieves, particles > 100 mu m).
   Location: North-south and east-west transects across Europe, covering the mediterranean, temperate, alpine, boreal and steppe biomes.
   Time period: Lake sediments and MODIS active fire and burned area products were collected for the years 2012-2015.
   Methods: Cylinder sediment traps were installed in lakes to annually collect charcoal particles in sediments. We quantitatively assessed the relationships between MIC and MAC influx (particles/cm(2)/year) and the MODIS-derived products to identify source areas of charcoal and the extent to which lake-sediment charcoal is linked to fire parameters across the continent.
   Results: Source area of sedimentary charcoal was estimated to a 40-km radius around sites for both MIC and MAC particles. Fires occurred in grasslands and in forests, with grass morphotypes of MAC accurately reflecting the burned fuel-type. Despite the lack of local fires around the sites, MAC influx levels reached those reported for local fires. Both MIC and MAC showed strong and highly significant relationships with the MODIS-derived fire parameters, as well as with climatic variation along a latitudinal temperature gradient.
   Main conclusions: MIC and MAC are suited to quantitatively reconstructing fire number and fire intensity on a regional scale. However, burned area may only be estimated using MAC. Local fires may be identified by using several lines of evidence, e.g. analysis of large particles (> 600 mu m), magnetic susceptibility and sedimentological data. Our results offer new insights and applications to quantitatively reconstruct fires and to interpret available sedimentary charcoal records.

AB Introduction: Muscle changes in patients with diabetes and lower leg pain due to chronic exertional compartment syndrome (CECS) were investigated before and after fasciotomy. Methods: The tibialis anterior muscle was analyzed with histochemical and morphological techniques in 7 patients with diabetes and CECS before fasciotomy and in 5 of them 1 year after fasciotomy. Nondiabetic patients with CECS and healthy participants served as references. Results: Before treatment, walking distance until occurrence of pain was limited (<0.2 km). Intramuscular pressure was significantly higher than in reference participants. Muscle analysis showed changes pathognomonic for neuropathy and myopathy and a restricted capillary network, with significantly more severe changes in the muscles of patients with diabetes than in the muscles of nondiabetic patients. Treatment with fasciotomy improved clinical signs, increased walking ability, and reduced muscle abnormalities, but muscle capillarization remained low. Discussion: Patients with diabetes and CECS have distinct pathological changes in affected muscles. Pressure-relieving fasciotomy triggers a regenerative response in the muscle tissue but not in the capillary bed.
